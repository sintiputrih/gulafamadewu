As a tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs, Kelce's innate athleticism, particularly in his blocking and receiving abilities, has played a considerable role in the team's success.</p><p>Kelce first entered the NFL in 2013; since then, his star has risen on and off the field. He first catapulted into the entertainment realm with his E! Network dating show, Chasing Kelce. Since he began his very public yet short-lived relationship with the competition's winner, Maya Benberry, fans and the media have been immensely interested in the tight end's dating life.</p><p>In September 2023, Kelce began dating <a href=#><strong>musician</strong></a><strong> <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a></strong>. Since Kelce and Swift have gone public with their romance, fans of the pair cannot get enough of the power couple; this leaves people wondering exactly what Travis Kelce thought about his bachelor days before he began his whirlwind romance with Taylor Swift.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-travis-kelce-had-to-say-about-being-single-before-he-dated-taylor-swift>What Travis Kelce Had To Say About Being Single Before He Dated Taylor Swift</h2><p>In January 2023, several months before <strong>Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift were confirmed to be a couple</strong>, the Kansas City Chief football player appeared on the "Shots Podcast Network."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screen-shot-2023-03-05-at-9-21-26-am.jpg><p>The video accompanying the appearance has garnered well over 1 million viewers as of early November 2023, proving just how popular Kelce is with fans.</p><p>During a particular segment of the show, one of the hosts began relaying his experience with an ex-girlfriend to the audience and Kelce, which prompted him to ask <strong>Kelce about his days as a single man</strong>.</p><p>The specific question posed to Travis Kelce was:</p><ul><li>What was the wildest thing a girl had ever done to get his attention?</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After collecting himself after hearing the rather bold question,<strong> Kelce got serious and said he would have to say persistence</strong>.
