Despite being active since 2003, he rose to prominence with the releases of 2021's "Son of a Sinner" and 2023's "Need a Favor." He received additional praise with the release of his song, "Save Me," in which he wears his vulnerability on his sleeve and reveals his emotional turmoil with his lyrics.</p><p>Jelly Roll has since become a major country music star. He has been nominated for and won several country music awards in 2023. In 2024, he was even nominated for two Grammy Awards.</p><p>He continues to rise in the music industry and has even become a staunch advocate against distributing illegal drugs following his own stint with substance abuse. Among his growing achievements, Jelly Roll has also committed to a new fitness journey after running in a 5k race. Here's what we know so far.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Jelly Roll is committed to weight loss after competing in a 5k race.</h2><p>In early May 2024, Jelly Roll competed in a 5k run. The event, titled "2 Bears 5K," was announced by 2 Bears, 1 Cave podcast hosts and comedians <a href=#>Tom Segura</a> and <a href=#>Bert Kreischer</a> and presented by Netflix is a Joke Fest.</p><p>Jelly Roll spoke about his journey during an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a> with Entertainment Tonight, in which he divulged how hard he had worked to be able to participate in the event.</p><p>"I couldn't walk a mile when I started trying to do this back in January," he told the outlet. "So the fact that we got 3-point-whatever it was, got it down, I felt really, really good about it."</p><p>He was incredibly proud of himself after completing the run, and it just goes to show how much his hard work and training has paid off leading up to the 5k.</p><p>According to Jelly Roll, he had lost somewhere between 50–70 pounds in preparing for the race, which is quite an impressive feat. What's more, he has even inspired others after participating in the run.</p><p>"I think the coolest thing is how many people stopped to tell us that they were motivated by us, other big guys," he told Entertainment Tonight.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><p>His participation in the 5k came after the country singer stepped away from social media for an extended period. In an episode of her Dumb Blonde podcast, Jelly Roll's <a href=#>wife</a> Bunnie XO revealed that her husband had been bullied extensively for his weight on all of his social media challenges, prompting his break from his platforms.</p><p>At the time, she stressed, "Don't bully people because you never know where they are mentally."</p><p>Jelly Roll has returned to social media following his weight loss and is already super excited to keep running, declaring, "Next year, a half marathon! We're saying it now, absolutely!"</p><p>We wish Jelly Roll all the best as he works towards his fitness goals.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7KtuNhmqaiknGLEprXGoatmpJ%2BowA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjelly-roll-weight-loss.html&text=Jelly%20Roll%20Opens%20Up%20About%20Ongoing%20Weight-Loss%20Journey&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjelly-roll-weight-loss.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjelly-roll-weight-loss.html&title=Jelly%20Roll%20Opens%20Up%20About%20Ongoing%20Weight-Loss%20Journey" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjelly-roll-weight-loss.html&title=Jelly%20Roll%20Opens%20Up%20About%20Ongoing%20Weight-Loss%20Journey" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjelly-roll-weight-loss.html&title=Jelly%20Roll%20Opens%20Up%20About%20Ongoing%20Weight-Loss%20Journey" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjelly-roll-weight-loss.html&description=Jelly%20Roll%20Opens%20Up%20About%20Ongoing%20Weight-Loss%20Journey" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jontron-jonathan-jafari.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="JonTron Net Worth | Wife">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tom-sandoval-girlfriend-is-he-still-dating-raquel-leviss-wiki-and-dating-history.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tom Sandoval Girlfriend: Is He Still Dating Raquel Leviss?
