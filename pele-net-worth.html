Dondinho and Celeste named their son after the great inventor Thomas Edison.</p><p>As the years went by, Edson’s friends nicknamed him Pele after the Vasco da Gama goalkeeper, Bile. Although the names don’t match, it was initially a way of teasing Edson due to mispronunciation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Pele-Early-Life-Source-Biography.jpg><p>Moreover, Pele, as a kid, was struck by poverty. To earn a living, he would work as a servant.</p><p>He first came to admire soccer through his father. Unable to collect money to buy a soccer ball, he would wrap newspaper in socks and tie them with a string.</p><p>With an innate passion, Pele first joined amateur sides like Sete de Setembro, Canto do Rio, São Paulinho, and Amériquinha; later, the Brazilian player sharpened his skills.</p><h2>Soccer Career Salary & Incomes</h2><p>Historically speaking, no soccer player of the 21st century can manage to rule over Pele’s throne. Only Lionel&nbsp;Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are closer to challenging the Brazilian milestone with a seemingly unbreakable record.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Pele-football.jpg><p>Another milestone he set was scoring the most soccer goals for a single club, Santos FC.</p><p>The icon played for two decades at Santos FC throughout his career, and upon nearing his retirement, he moved to New York Cosmos and played for three full seasons.</p><p>With a highlight of a 37-year-long career, Pele amassed a <strong>$15 million</strong> sum.</p><p>Declaring a national treasure by the then Brazilian President only boosted his reputation and significantly bumped his paycheck.</p><p>While this may be true, the actual salary Santos FC paid Pele is not available to the public. When the Brazilian national treasure started playing for New York Cosmos, he pocketed almost <strong>$6 million</strong> by the end of his contract.</p><p>Pele earned nearly<strong> $14 million</strong> through endorsement deals & About <strong>$15 million</strong> from soccer .</p><p>The amount he earned during his playing career might seem pale on present-age soccer contracts and wages, but let us remind you he was the highest-paid athlete accounting for every sport.</p><h2>Pele | Jersey</h2><p>Pele wore jersey number 10 for the Brazilian national team and a few other clubs. Since the legend of soccer wore the number, number 10 is important in Brazil and different places.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Pele-Jersey-Number-Source-El-Futbolero-Ecuador.jpg><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Neymar</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Ronaldinho</a> also inherited the same number. Here’s a picture of the legendary man wearing his number 10 jersey</p><h2>Records Set By Pele</h2><p>Here are a few records set by Pele that stands still today:</p><ul><li>Pele scored 92 hat-tricks, equating to 276 goals if we just look at the officially recognized fixtures. Also, he scored more goals in those 92 games than most strikers in their careers.</li><li>Pele was the youngest player to score a hat trick in World Cup.</li><li>He won the highest number of World Cup trophies.</li><li>He also holds the record for having the most World Cup assists.</li><li>Pele recorded 95 goals in 114 games for Brazil, and 77 goals from 92 official caps received recognition from FIFA. This makes him Brazils’s Record Goal Scorer.</li><li>Pele, at 17, was the youngest player to be named to a World Cup Squad. Likewise, he was the youngest player in the world cup.</li></ul><p>These records have been broken now. However, Pele is still the youngest player to have won the World Cup.</p><h2>Movies, Investments, Endorsements & Book Publications</h2><p>Upon concluding his soccer career, Pele’s primary source of income was endorsement deals.</p><p>As such, Pele agreed to endorse Puma, Hublot, Volkswagen, Subway, Emirates, and Santander. The retired icon pocketed almost $14 million from his commercial contracts.</p><p>In 1994, UNESCO appointed the Brazilian as its Goodwill Ambassador. Due to his inspirational status, Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso announced Pele as an Extraordinary Minister for Sport.</p><p>After a short duration of his ascension to the post, the soccer legend proposed a law to uproot corruption in soccer, now dubbed the Pele Law.</p><p>When Pele was accused of laundering money from UNICEF, he chose to resign from the post.</p><p>After that, the retired Santos legend founded a television company that acquired the rights to broadcast matches and other international contests.</p><p>The company’s current status isn’t discussed in the media these days.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Pele-Makes-A-Cameo-In-A-Movie-About-His-Life.-Source-Pinterest.jpg><p>In his retirement, the legendary soccer player had the chance to reflect upon his achievements, lowest points, and family.</p><p>As a result, Pele published several autobiographies.</p><p>A celebrity in and out of the soccer world, his books were highly appreciated and became best-sellers in his native Brazil and several other countries.</p><h2>Career Outside Football&nbsp;</h2><p>In the same way, Pele officially became an actor in 1969 with the television series Os Estranhos.</p><p>Not limited to this, the Brazilian returned to the cinematic world with a few other documentaries and movies, like O Barão Otelo no Barato dos Bilhões, A Marcha, A Minor Miracle, Pedro Mico, Hotshot, Os Trapalhões e o Rei do Futebol, Solidão, and Uma Linda História de Amor.</p><p>He appeared alongside Sylvester Stallone, Michael Caine, and other 60s-70s-era&nbsp;players in a telenovela called Os Estranhos and similarly in a cameo role in Pele: Birth of a Legend.</p><h2>Houses, Lifestyle, & Cars</h2><p>Often called The King, the star had many financial assets and other properties bought during/after his rise to fame.</p><p>The Brazilian owned various cars and real estate, therefore, lived an exquisite life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/pele-net-worth.2.jpg><p>Reportedly in January 2018, the Brazilian purchased a house valued at <strong>$4 million</strong>.</p><p>The house has a swimming pool, jacuzzi, sauna, a home office, a sports room, and a parking lot.&nbsp;The compound is estimated to be laid out on a large acre of land.</p><p>Similarly, the legend purchased a sweet retreat at 156 Waterhole Road, near East End Waterfront, for <strong>$156k</strong>.</p><p>At present, the property has a value of around <strong>$2.5 million</strong>.
