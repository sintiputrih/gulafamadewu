Paul finished top in the first round of voting and will now progress to the runoff round. Vallas is expected to face up against incumbent Lori Lightfoot.&nbsp;Lightfoot made history four years ago when she became the first Black woman to be elected mayor of Chicago, winning all 50 wards. However, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot was defeated in her re-election campaign on Tuesday.</p><p>During the epidemic, Chicago had an increase in violent crime, and voters were unsatisfied with her management of crime and police in the city. Paul Vallas, a former public school leader, and Brandon Johnson, a county board commissioner, were the two candidates that proceeded to the April 4 runoff.</p><h2>Paul Vallas’s Religion: Is He Christian Or Jewish?</h2><p>The politician has not said which faith he follows. He may be an Orthodox Christian due to his Greek-American parentage. Vallas started his work in the early 1980s as a budget analyst for the City of Chicago. He then worked as the city’s budget director and as Mayor Richard M. Daley’s chief of staff.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Paul-Vallas-1.jpg alt="Paul Vallas" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Vallas was named CEO of the Chicago Public Schools in 1995, where he oversaw major increases in student performance, test scores, and graduation rates. After leaving the Chicago Public Schools, Vallas took administrative posts in the school systems of Philadelphia, New Orleans, and Bridgeport, Connecticut.&nbsp;He has run for office, running for Lieutenant Governor of Illinois in 2014 and Mayor of Chicago in 2019.&nbsp;Vallas has long fought for school reform and has developed strategies to enhance student outcomes and accountability.</p><p>He has also received recognition for his fiscal management abilities, having effectively balanced budgets in various government institutions.&nbsp;In addition to his work in government and education, Vallas has taught public policy and administration courses at the university level.&nbsp;He graduated with honors from Illinois State University and the University of Illinois at Chicago.</p><h2>Paul Vallas’s Family, Ethnicity, and Origin</h2><p>Paul Vallas was born on June 10, 1953, in Chicago, Illinois, to a Greek-American family. Her parents’ names have not been revealed by the politician.&nbsp;His parents were also Greek immigrants who emigrated to the United States. Vallas grew up on Chicago’s South Side in the Roseland neighborhood.&nbsp;He grew raised in the Chicago suburbs, and throughout his adolescence, he lived in Palos Heights.</p><p>Vallas graduated from Carl Sandburg High School and attended Moraine Valley Community College. He graduated from Western Illinois University with a bachelor’s degree in history and a master’s degree in political science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. As a Greek-American, Vallas has been engaged in a variety of Greek cultural and community groups.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Paul-Vallas-2.jpg alt="Paul Vallas" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>As superintendent of schools in Chicago, Philadelphia, and New Orleans, he has also served in political and educational leadership capacities.&nbsp;From 1985 until 1990, Paul Vallas was the chairman of the Illinois Economic and Fiscal Commission.&nbsp;From 1990 to 1993, he was the municipal budget director for Chicago under Mayor Richard M. Daley.&nbsp;Vallas and his wife, Sharon Vallas, have three children: Gus, Mark, and Paul Jr. Vallas’s son Mark died in 2018 as a result of opiate addiction.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGinmq2cYsOiuMuaqmavmaC2bsPHmqusZZiewG6x06GlopuZqcZuvM6loK2hk56ur3nRnqOin5mku26tzZ1kn5mdnrm6ew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fpaul-vallas-wiki-whats-his-ethnicity-politician-religion-and-family.html&text=Paul%20Vallas%20Wiki%3a%20Whats%20His%20Ethnicity%3f%20Politician%20Religion%20And%20Family&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpaul-vallas-wiki-whats-his-ethnicity-politician-religion-and-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpaul-vallas-wiki-whats-his-ethnicity-politician-religion-and-family.html&title=Paul%20Vallas%20Wiki%3a%20Whats%20His%20Ethnicity%3f%20Politician%20Religion%20And%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fpaul-vallas-wiki-whats-his-ethnicity-politician-religion-and-family.html&title=Paul%20Vallas%20Wiki%3a%20Whats%20His%20Ethnicity%3f%20Politician%20Religion%20And%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fpaul-vallas-wiki-whats-his-ethnicity-politician-religion-and-family.html&title=Paul%20Vallas%20Wiki%3a%20Whats%20His%20Ethnicity%3f%20Politician%20Religion%20And%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpaul-vallas-wiki-whats-his-ethnicity-politician-religion-and-family.html&description=Paul%20Vallas%20Wiki%3a%20Whats%20His%20Ethnicity%3f%20Politician%20Religion%20And%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-gia-animal-kingdom.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Gia in 'Animal Kingdom' Season 6?
