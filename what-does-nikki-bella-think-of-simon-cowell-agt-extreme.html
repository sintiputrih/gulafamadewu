This past February, the first three episodes of America's Got Talent: Extreme broadcast on NBC, including one sneak peek episode on February 20. The new spin-off of the cult-classic AGT focuses purely on stunt performers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As with most other shows on the franchise, Cowell features as one of the judges, this time alongside motor sports competitor Travis Pastrana and WWE star Nikki Bella. The latter is a hall-of-famer in the wrestling outfit.</p><p>She was also once famously engaged to fellow WWE superstar John Cena. They broke off their engagement just under one month to their wedding in April 2018, although <a href=#>they remain in touch every so often</a>.</p><p>Bella's debut on AGT: Extreme continues her growing legacy as a recognized television personality, following her stints on shows like Total Divas, Total Bellas, and the season she spent as a contestant on Dancing with the Stars.</p><p>Nonetheless, getting to share a platform with a <a href=#>seasoned reality competition shows pro like Cowell</a> would have been a nerve-wracking experience for her. Thankfully, the Englishman proved to be a lot less intimidating in person, and a great help to Bella as she adjusts to the AGT world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-nikki-bella-thinks-of-simon-cowell>What Nikki Bella Thinks Of Simon Cowell?</h2><p>Bella and Pastrana joined America's Got Talent in late 2021, when NBC announced the line-up for their then-upcoming show. Joining Cowell and the pair was AGT veteran Terry Crews, as the host.</p><p>Filming began in September, and carried on all the way through to January 2022, albeit with a hiatus following an accident on set. Following the half hour sneak peek on February 20, the first episode of Extreme eventually aired the following day, to a great reception from audiences.</p><p>Bella could not have passed up the chance to be a part of the show, expressing her delight that performers like her now get the opportunity to showcase their talents - and that she gets to judge them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Happened Between Nikki Bella And John Cena?</a></span></p><p>"When the opportunity came to me, I was super excited just to know that these people with these incredible crafts and talents now finally get a platform to showcase that," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she recently said to People magazine</a>.

After she had processed the grand opportunity that she had just landed, it dawned on her that she would also be working alongside some of the biggest stars in their respective industries. This thought was quite daunting to her at first.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"To know that I'm sharing the judging panel with Simon Cowell and Travis Pastrana, I'm not going to lie, at first I was very intimidated," she explained. She would, however, very quickly come to realize that he fears were relatively unfounded, as they all hit the ground running with their working relationship.</p><p>"It was like instant chemistry with them and Terry Crews on top of it, I learned a lot," Bella continued. "I laughed a lot. I even cried. But it was an amazing time, and it was really neat to go through. I mean, Travis is a king of extreme, and there's no more iconic judge than Simon Cowell."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Nikki Bella Gets Slammed As Harsh Video Shows Her Bullying WWE Wrestler Chyna</a></span></p><p>Although <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cowell is generally known as the king of savage</a>, Bella found was immediately struck by his humility.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nikki-bella-thinks-that-simon-cowell-is-different-from-what-her-perception-was>Nikki Bella Thinks That Simon Cowell Is Different From What Her Perception Was</h2><p>As she was on her way to her first meeting with Cowell, the wrestler recalled being a bundle of nerves. "I remember I was on the car ride over, just super intimidated," she recounted. "I'm listening to meditation music because I'm going in as a judge for the first time next to Simon. I just wanted to give my best, give my all."</p><p>Instead of the intimidating figure she would have watched on TV over the years, Bella was instead met by a very welcoming and mentoring Cowell. "From the moment that I met him, he was so down to earth and humble and gave Travis and me amazing advice, he was very inviting," she said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bella's last big TV project was Dancing with the Stars in 2017, where she was eliminated sixth alongside her professional partner Artem Chigvintsev.
