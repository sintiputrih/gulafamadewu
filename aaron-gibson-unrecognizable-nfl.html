I ate like that until exhaustion."</p><p>Gibson estimates that he sank between 20,000 to 30,000 calories per day, sneaking snacks past his conditioning coaches.</p><p>Despite his immense size and appetite, Gibson excelled in his new right tackle position and was a consensus All-American in 1999.</p><p>He was selected by the <a href=#>Detroit Lions</a> in the NFL Draft later that year - where teammates were stunned by his portion size.</p><p>Fellow Lions rookie Nakia Codie told Bleacher: "I don't know how he burned it off.</p><p>"How do you eat that much food, and then still be hungry two hours later? This guy was eating meals every two hours."</p><p>Gibson was once fined $80,000 for arriving at camp overweight, per Bleacher.</p><p>And persistent Injuries would mean that Gibson never got to fulfill his potential in the <a href=#>NFL</a>.</p><p>He left the league in 2004 following spells with the Cowboys and Chicago Bears, playing sporadically for a number of Arena franchises over the following seasons.</p><p>Gibson ballooned up to 480 pounds after football, spending four years depressed and eating poorly in <a href=#>Dallas</a>.</p><p>But after meeting partner Brigitte, he was inspired to start exercising again and challenged himself to eat better.</p><p>Gibson dropped 100 pounds in a single year, crashing out intense workouts that involved 1,500 crunches a day.</p><p>He explained: "I went hard. I was not going to stop.</p><p>"You do all of this work, eating all the food, and preparing and doing all of that and it's worth it.</p><p>"You see the numbers going off on the scale, which is awesome."</p><p>Gibson eventually got down to 290 pounds, dropping a remarkable 14 inches off his waist.</p><p>He struggled with his mobility after receiving a poisonous spider bite in his yard, resulting in the loss of one of his toes.</p><p>But Gibson recently shared a snap on his Instagram, showcasing his epic transformation with a ripped torso.</p><p>He captioned the pic: "Finally under 300lbs.. was 480lbs now let’s see where I can get myself."</p><p>One fan replied to the snap: "Looking good Big Gib."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Another said: "I am so proud of you!!!
