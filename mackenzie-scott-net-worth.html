She has a net worth of US$33.4 billion as of September 2023 thanks to her 4% ownership position in Jeff Bezos’ company, Amazon</p><p>On July 13, 2020, MacKenzie attained the title of the richest woman in the world for the first time as Amazon broke the $3,300 per share barrier. Actually, she didn’t retain the title for the entire day. By the end of the trading day, Amazon had lost several percentage points, handing Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers the victory once again.</p><p>A few months later, MacKenzie started giving vast sums of money to charities, which made it much harder for her to keep her title as the richest woman in the world.</p><p>She is well-known for being Jeff Bezos’s wife from 1993 to 2019. Together, Jeff and MacKenzie are parents to four kids. Since 2018, Jeff has held the title of the world’s richest person.

She was given the name Cuming in honor of her maternal grandfather, G. Scott Cuming, who served as general counsel and executive at El Paso Natural Gas. When she was six years old, she authored The Novel Worm, a 142-page book that was lost in a flood, and she recalls taking writing seriously for the first time.</p><p>She completed her education at Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Connecticut, in 1988.</p><p>At Princeton University, where she studied under Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison, Tuttle received her bachelor’s degree in English in 1992. Morrison praised Tuttle as “one of the best students I’ve ever had in my creative writing classes.”&nbsp; She also assisted Morrison with research for the 1992 book Jazz.</p><h2><strong>Mackenzie Scott Career</strong></h2><p>Scott’s first book, The Testing of Luther Albright, was published in 2005. In 2006, it was honored with an American Book Award. As she was assisting Bezos in the development of Amazon, giving birth to three children, and raising them, she claimed that it took her 10 years to complete her book.&nbsp; She had studied with Toni Morrison, who called the work “a rarity: a cerebral novel that fractures and fills the heart.” Traps, her second book, was released in 2013.</p><h2><strong>Mackenzie Scott Personal Life</strong></h2><p>From 1993 to 2019, Scott was wed to Jeff Bezos, the creator of Amazon and Blue Origin. She first met him in 1992 while working as his assistant at D. E. Shaw. After dating for three months in New York, they got engaged, and in 1994 they moved to Seattle, Washington. They have three sons and one daughter, totaling four kids. Their adopted daughter is from China.</p><p>Scott received US$35.6 billion in Amazon stock as part of their 2019 community property divorce, while her ex-husband kept 75% of the couple’s Amazon stock.</p><p>In April 2019, she rose to become the third-richest woman in the world and one of the richest individuals. With a net worth estimated at $36 billion in July 2020, Scott was ranked as the 22nd richest person in the world by Forbes. Scott was recognized as the richest woman in the world by September 2020, and by December 2020, experts estimated her net worth to be $62 billion.</p><p>MacKenzie Bezos changed her name to MacKenzie Scott after she and Jeff Bezos got divorced, with the last name coming from her middle name.</p><p>She later wed Dan Jewett, a chemistry teacher in a high school. Jewett’s Giving Pledge letter from March 6, 2021, revealed the marriage. In September 2022, she filed for divorce from Jewett.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/mackenzie-husband-1.jpg alt width=1200 height=700 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Philanthropy</strong></h2><p>Scott committed to giving away the majority of her wealth to charity over her life or in her will when she signed the Giving Pledge in May 2019. Despite its name, the pledge is not enforceable.</p><p>Scott revealed that she had given $1.7 billion to 116 non-profit groups with a focus on racial equality, LGBTQ+ equality, democracy, and climate change in a July 2020 Medium post. Over $800 million has been donated by her to HBCUs, Hispanic-serving organizations, tribal colleges and universities, and other colleges. Less than six months later, in December 2020, Scott said that she had contributed an additional $4.15 billion to 384 groups in the previous four months with an emphasis on helping those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic’s economic effects and tackling long-term systemic injustices.</p><p>She claimed that while the US battled with the unprecedented effects of COVID-19 and billionaires’ wealth continued to rise, she wanted her advisory team to distribute her fortune more quickly following July. “Identifying organizations with excellent leadership teams and results, with special attention to those working in places suffering high projected food insecurity, high measures of racial disparity, high local poverty rates, and little access to donor money,” was the focus of her team. [33] Scott made one of the largest annual contributions by a private individual to active organizations in 2020, contributing a total of $5.8 billion to charity.</p><p>Scott declared even another $2.7 billion in donations to 286 organizations on June 15, 2021.</p><p>According to Forbes, Scott gave to 780 organizations $8.5 billion in a single year (July 2020 to July 2021). The Equality Can’t-Wait Challenge, a competition to advance gender equality and increase women’s power and influence in the United States by 2030, was introduced by Scott and Melinda French Gates in June 2021. Each of the four winners received $10 million, with the remaining $8 million going to the two finalists. Nine organizations received gifts from Scott totaling $264.5 million, which were revealed in February 2022.</p><p>More donations were made public on March 23, 2022, including $275 million for Planned Parenthood and $436 million for Habitat for Humanity. The Big Brothers Big Sisters charity announced in May 2022 that Mackenzie Scott had donated $122.6 million. Scott has made donations to non-American organizations, including those in Kenya, India, Brazil, Micronesia, and Latin America.</p><p>The New York Times reported in April 2022 that Scott’s donations since 2019 have surpassed $12 billion.&nbsp; In September 2022, Scott gave the California Community Foundation (CCF), which awards grants to charitable organizations with a mission in Los Angeles, two of her Beverly Hills residences, totaling $55 million in value. The organization plans to sell both houses and donate 90% of the proceeds to programs promoting affordable housing and the remaining 10% to a program promoting immigrant integration.</p><p>According to Forbes, “Scott’s philanthropy’s unfettered and ultimately more trusting nature is the exception, not the rule in their society.”</p><p>According to the New York Times, “Ms. Scott has flipped conventional philanthropy on its head… by disbursing her money promptly and without much fanfare, Ms. Scott has diverted the spotlight away from the giver and onto the NGOs she is attempting to support.” “Teams with expertise on the front lines of problems will know best how to put the money to good use,” Scott has stated.A controversy erupted after Scott stated in a Medium post from December 2021 that she would not reveal how much money she had given away or to whom. Since then, she has declared that her team will create a website to disseminate information on her donations.</p><p>Read More</p><ul><li class="is-title post-title"><a href=#>Emma Chamberlain Net Worth: How Much Money Does The Youtuber Have?</a></li><li class="is-title post-title"><a href=#>Coolio’s Net Worth: Is Coolio A Billionaire?
