It appears that many viewers are also willing to go to great lengths to view these commercials beyond their original air date during the big game. During the 2019 Super Bowl, consumers spent a total of 641 thousand hours watching Super Bowl ads on YouTube, which represents a 58 percent increase from the previous year.</p><h2 id=how-much-do-celebrities-like-miles-teller-get-paid-for-super-bowl-commercials>How Much Do Celebrities Like Miles Teller Get Paid For Super Bowl Commercials?</h2><p>Commercials during the Super Bowl have become a lucrative source of income for celebrities, with advertisers paying around $4.5 million for a 30-second spot. Celebrities can earn anywhere from $500,000 to $2 million, depending on the commercial and the star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While A-listers do not receive higher pay just for appearing in Super Bowl ads, the exposure is often incentive enough to sign up. Celebrities have reportedly <a href=#>earned millions from Super Bowl commercials such as Kate Upton</a>, Brad Pitt, and Arnold Schwarzenegger. However, some celebrities, like Will Ferrell, are willing to appear in ads for free, simply for the fun of it.</p><p>Additionally, members of the winning Super Bowl team will take home a bonus of $102,000, which pales in comparison to the potential earnings from commercials.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/th-image-template-21.jpg><p>Actor <a href=#>Miles Teller and his wife, Keleigh Sperry</a>, starred in a Bud Light commercial during the 2023 Super Bowl. The ad highlights the couple's dance skills as they groove throughout the day while on hold with a customer service representative. The couple took full advantage of the opportunity, going above and beyond to make the commercial memorable by involving their pet dog, Bugsy, in the festivities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Was Miles Teller's Top Gun: Maverick Salary The Biggest Payday Of His Career?">Was Miles Teller's Top Gun: Maverick Salary The Biggest Payday Of His Career?</a></span></p><p>Besides the bragging rights of appearing in a Super Bowl ad, Teller jokingly shares his hopes for a lifetime supply of Bud Light as a bonus, although it has not been confirmed. As a diehard Philadelphia Eagles fan, Teller was invested in the matchup between the Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs and describes it as a whole situation in their house.</p><h2 id=how-much-does-a-single-super-bowl-ad-cost-in-2023>How Much Does A Single Super Bowl Ad Cost In 2023?</h2><p>Super Bowl commercials are <a href=#>becoming increasingly expensive</a>, but companies continue to pay top dollar for the chance to reach millions of viewers. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox Sports</a>, most 30-second ad spots for Super Bowl LVII cost between $6 million and $7 million, with some selling for more than $7 million. This does not include the cost of producing the ads, which can be substantial for elaborate and star-studded commercials.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/th-image-template-1-6.jpg><p>The Super Bowl provides a unique opportunity for companies to reach a massive audience, with more than 100 million people expected to tune in. Ad spots for the first Super Bowl in 1967 cost a mere $37,500 (about $338,000 in today's dollars), but the average price had reached $1 million by the mid-1990s. In 2022, the price rose to $6.5 million, up from $5.5 million in 2021. Looking back at the cost in previous years:</p><ul><li>2020 - $5.6 million</li><li>2019 - $5.3 million</li><li>2018 - $5.2 million</li><li>2017 - $5 million</li><li>2016 - $4.5 million</li><li>2015 - $4.25 million</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This year's Super Bowl commercials included a wide range of products and services, such as beverages, snacks, cars, entertainment, and technology. In June of last year, Anheuser-Busch, the parent company of Bud Light, announced the end of its exclusivity deal that was first established in 1989.</p><p>Nonetheless, the company remains a significant presence at NFL games, sponsoring all major off-season NFL moments, including the 2022 NFL Draft in Las Vegas. Despite no longer holding exclusive rights, Anheuser-Busch remains the largest beverage advertiser during the Super Bowl, with three minutes of national airtime and a 30-second regional Budweiser spot.</p><h2 id=what-was-the-song-from-the-miles-teller-bud-light-super-bowl-ad>What Was The Song From The Miles Teller Bud Light Super Bowl Ad?</h2><p>One element of the Bud Light Super Bowl commercial that has garnered attention is the hold music featured in the ad. Many viewers have expressed their interest in knowing the name of the song, as it is often associated with the experience of being put on hold during a phone call.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The music has been praised for making the typically frustrating experience of waiting on hold more tolerable or even enjoyable. Viewers are interested in identifying the song so that they can listen to it on their own terms and without any interruptions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/miles-teller-keleigh-sperry.png><p>The song is 'Opus 1' by Tim Carleton and Darrick Deel. It has gained notoriety due to its presence as a default hold music on Cisco phone systems. The composition was created in 1989 by the then-16-year-old composers using a four-track recorder. They were both Yanni enthusiasts and shared a passion for music production.</p><p>Carleton offered the song to the design team when he began working for Cisco Systems in the 1990s, and it was incorporated into the final product for the company's phone systems. Despite its widespread use, Carleton neglected to copyright the tune or establish a licensing agreement, so he has not received any royalties for its usage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Musicians Who We Think Should Play The Super Bowl Halftime Show">Musicians Who We Think Should Play The Super Bowl Halftime Show</a></span></p><p>The Super Bowl has become more than just a major sporting event in the United States. It is also a massive opportunity for advertisers to reach millions of viewers and create buzz around their products or services.</p><p>The cost of Super Bowl advertisements continues to rise, not only due to the number of viewers but also because of the level of engagement and attention these ads receive.
