So, when the show premiered on Channel 9 and 9Now on 30 January 2023, we were introduced to Dan Hunjas as one of its new cast.</p><p>More about the career-driven, charming, successful, semi-retired Dan Hunjas we shall explore in this writing.</p><h3><strong>MAFS Australia: Are Sandy Jawanda And Dan Hunjas Still Together?</strong></h3><p>“Full of hope and excitement… Looking forward to meeting my active, fun, and fearless bride to join me on a lifetime of adventure. I hope she can keep up!”, Dan Hunjas was seen teasing a MAFS&nbsp;post on social media a couple of days before the show’s release.</p><p>So, once in this game, Dan was introduced to her, <a href=#>Sandy Jawanda</a>, his bride for the season. The two tied the knot during S10E02 of MAFS&nbsp;Australia. For someone who had never been in a serious relationship prior to this, getting married on a reality TV show was a huge decision for the Victorian dental therapist. Not able to get the approval of her traditional Indian parents, she walked down the aisle anyway though, with confidence. And Dan too at the time seemed in awe with the women who stood before him. However, this is not the case anymore. Dan has moved on from his beautiful Indian bride it seems.</p><p>Early in February 2023, Dan kind of confirmed it after being caught kissing another “busty” brunette who once attended his and Sandy’s TV wedding. Yes, it’s the same <a href=#>Samantha Symes</a>, nurse, and influencer, who stole the show during the very wedding episode, when afterward guests were slammed for controversial comments. She had appeared at Dan and Sandy’s ceremony showing off her GG-cup cleavage in a low-cut orange dress.</p><p>Photos obtained by Daily Mail Australia from 27 January 2023 featured Dan packing on the PDA with Samantha at the Garden Kitchen and Bar at The Star Gold Coast. The media outlet also reported about the couple not being able to keep their hands or lips off each other as they dined out with friends.</p><p>Fans had already smelled something off, when before this Dan took a subtle swipe at his TV wife over her secret allergy to “saltwater” which was cut from the show.</p><p>Anyway, fans have been shocked to learn that Dan’s new bae, right now, is none other than a guest at his wedding.</p><p>Before Dan and Sandy’s wedding went on air on 31 January, Samantha had put online a photo of her and the groom looking all loved up. And then when people started talking, she hit back at haters in a series of Instagram comments saying reality TV is anything but real. She even chastised MAFS saying, “Who cares about MAFS or this crap.”</p><h3><strong>Dan Hunjas Age</strong></h3><p>Dan Hunjas was born in 1979.

Also, on her Facebook, she mentioned hailing from Hervey Bay, Queensland, and being a current dweller of Sunshine Coast, Queensland.</p><p>Dan believes the happiest times of his life have been with this very young lady who by October 2022 was a 16-year old.
