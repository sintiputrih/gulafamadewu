She was remembered at a memorial service at her local Church of Scientology over the weekend. Cruise, 54, and his sisters, Lee Ann DeVette, Cass Mapother, and Marian Henry, attended the ceremony along with other close friends and family members.</p><p>South, born Mary Lee Pfeiffer, was a special education teacher when she married Cruise's father, Thomas Cruise Mapother III. The family lived in Syracuse, New York, and Ottawa, Canada. South divorced Mapother in 1974 before returning to the United States.</p><p>The three-time Golden Globe winner shared a close relationship with his mother, particularly when he was growing up. He credited his love for acting to his mom, whose lifelong dream was to become a star. "I was always interested in theater, but I never did anything with it," South told <a href=#><i>Rolling Stone</i></a> in 1986.

Then to see him on that stage …"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Eventually, Cruise moved to New York City before landing a small role in 1981's romantic drama&nbsp;<i>Endless Love</i>, which starred <b><a href=#>Brooke Shields</a></b>. He became a household name two years later with <i>Risky Business</i>, in which he famously danced around in his underwear. In the following years, Cruise went on to star in <i>Top Gun</i>, <i>Rain Man</i>, <i>Born on the Fourth of July</i>, <i>A Few Good Men</i>, <i>Jerry&nbsp;Maguire</i>&nbsp;and many more blockbusters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatp51isLPByKycrGWdpLpuucCrsGaklZp6tLvUrZ9mnJmawG6t02ZvaWWimr2wvtNmrm1uZm2EcXs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftom-cruises-mom-mary-lee-south-dies-at-80-report-w466870.html&text=Tom%20Cruise%27s%20Mom%2c%20Mary%20Lee%20South%2c%20Dies%20at%2080&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftom-cruises-mom-mary-lee-south-dies-at-80-report-w466870.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftom-cruises-mom-mary-lee-south-dies-at-80-report-w466870.html&title=Tom%20Cruise%27s%20Mom%2c%20Mary%20Lee%20South%2c%20Dies%20at%2080" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftom-cruises-mom-mary-lee-south-dies-at-80-report-w466870.html&title=Tom%20Cruise%27s%20Mom%2c%20Mary%20Lee%20South%2c%20Dies%20at%2080" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftom-cruises-mom-mary-lee-south-dies-at-80-report-w466870.html&title=Tom%20Cruise%27s%20Mom%2c%20Mary%20Lee%20South%2c%20Dies%20at%2080" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftom-cruises-mom-mary-lee-south-dies-at-80-report-w466870.html&description=Tom%20Cruise%27s%20Mom%2c%20Mary%20Lee%20South%2c%20Dies%20at%2080" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./515543-who-attacked-dean-ambrose-after-smackdown-went-off-air-ticket-information-for-wwe-returning-to-south-carolina.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Attacked Dean Ambrose After Smackdown Went Off Air?
