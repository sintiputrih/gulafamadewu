But, there is often confusion between the German and American Rottweiler. To help clarify any confusion, this article will explore the key differences between the two variations of this breed.</p><h2><span id=History>History</span></h2><p>The Rottweiler breed originated in the German town of Rottweil. While the breed’s ancestors were used to pull carts and assist butchers, modern Rottweilers are primarily used as family pets or working dogs. The American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1931, and the German Kennel Club did the same in 1936.</p><h2><span id=Physical_Appearance>Physical Appearance</span></h2><p>The German and American Rottweilers differ in their physical appearance. German Rottweilers are larger and heavier than their American counterparts. The breed standard for the German Rottweiler requires that they have a broad head, a black nose, and a pronounced stop. The American Rottweiler, on the other hand, is smaller and lighter, with a smaller head and a less pronounced stop.</p><h2><span id=Personality>Personality</span></h2><p>German Rottweilers are known for their loyal and protective nature. They are very devoted to their owners and are highly intelligent. American Rottweilers, on the other hand, are generally more outgoing and friendly. They are also less likely to be aggressive and can be easily trained.</p><h2><span id=Training>Training</span></h2><p>German Rottweilers are known to be more stubborn and difficult to train than their American counterparts. They require more consistent and firm training to ensure that they understand commands and obey them. American Rottweilers are much easier to train and respond better to positive reinforcement.</p><h2><span id=Grooming>Grooming</span></h2><p>Both German and American Rottweilers require regular grooming to keep their coats healthy and looking their best. German Rottweilers have thicker, longer coats that require more frequent brushing and grooming. American Rottweilers have shorter, finer coats that require less brushing and grooming.</p><h2><span id=Health>Health</span></h2><p>German Rottweilers have a tendency to have more health issues than American Rottweilers. This is due to their larger size and thicker coats, which can lead to joint problems and other health issues. American Rottweilers tend to have fewer health issues due to their smaller size and shorter coats.</p><h2><span id=Lifespan>Lifespan</span></h2><p>The average lifespan of a German Rottweiler is 8-10 years, while the average lifespan of an American Rottweiler is 10-12 years. This is due to the fact that German Rottweilers are larger and more prone to health issues, while American Rottweilers are smaller and less prone to health issues.</p><h2><span id=Exercise>Exercise</span></h2><p>Both German and American Rottweilers require regular exercise to stay healthy and happy. German Rottweilers need more exercise than American Rottweilers due to their larger size and higher energy levels. American Rottweilers need less exercise due to their smaller size and lower energy levels.</p><h2><span id=Intelligence>Intelligence</span></h2><p>German Rottweilers are known for their intelligence and are often used as working dogs. American Rottweilers are also intelligent, but they are not as intelligent as their German counterparts. American Rottweilers are more suited to being family pets than working dogs.</p><h2><span id=Temperament>Temperament</span></h2><p>Both German and American Rottweilers are loyal and affectionate, but there are some differences in their temperaments. German Rottweilers are known to be more aloof and independent, while American Rottweilers are more outgoing and friendly. However, both breeds are devoted to their owners and make excellent family pets.</p><h2><span id=Size>Size</span></h2><p>German Rottweilers are much larger than American Rottweilers. The breed standard for the German Rottweiler requires them to be between 24-27 inches tall and weigh between 100-135 pounds. The breed standard for the American Rottweiler requires them to be between 22-25 inches tall and weigh between 75-95 pounds.</p><h2><span id=Coat_Color>Coat Color</span></h2><p>German Rottweilers tend to have darker coats than American Rottweilers. The breed standard for the German Rottweiler requires them to have a black coat with tan or mahogany markings. The breed standard for the American Rottweiler requires them to have a black coat with tan or mahogany markings, but they can also have lighter coats.</p><h2><span id=Head_Shape>Head Shape</span></h2><p>The head shape of a German Rottweiler is much broader than that of an American Rottweiler. The breed standard for the German Rottweiler requires them to have a broad head, a black nose, and a pronounced stop. The breed standard for the American Rottweiler requires them to have a smaller head and a less pronounced stop.</p><h2><span id=Ears>Ears</span></h2><p>The ears of a German Rottweiler are larger and more erect than those of an American Rottweiler. The breed standard for the German Rottweiler requires them to have large, triangular ears that are erect and point outward. The breed standard for the American Rottweiler requires them to have smaller ears that are slightly curved and hang down.</p><h2><span id=Tail>Tail</span></h2><p>The tail of a German Rottweiler is thicker and longer than that of an American Rottweiler. The breed standard for the German Rottweiler requires them to have a thick, long tail that is carried low. The breed standard for the American Rottweiler requires them to have a thinner, shorter tail that is carried high.</p><h2><span id=Behavioral_Traits>Behavioral Traits</span></h2><p>German Rottweilers are known to be more independent and aloof than American Rottweilers. They are also more territorial and protective of their owners. American Rottweilers, on the other hand, are known to be more outgoing and friendly. They are also less territorial and more easygoing.</p><h2><span id=Price>Price</span></h2><p>German Rottweilers tend to be more expensive than American Rottweilers due to their rarity and larger size. German Rottweilers can cost upwards of $2,000, while American Rottweilers can cost anywhere from $800 to $1,500.</p><h2><span id=Conclusion>Conclusion</span></h2><p>German and American Rottweilers are both beloved breeds of dog, with their loyal and protective nature. However, there are some key differences between the two variations of this breed. While German Rottweilers are larger and heavier, American Rottweilers are smaller and lighter. German Rottweilers are also more stubborn and difficult to train, while American Rottweilers are easier to train and respond better to positive reinforcement. Ultimately, both breeds make excellent family pets and are devoted to their owners.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunCwyJ%2BdnqqVo7CmecGeq7CdlaN6qLHRppinZZGjsW6tzJ6popuRo3qzu9Otrp6hnJq%2FtHs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdifference-between-german-and-american-rottweilers.html&text=Difference%20Between%20German%20And%20American%20Rottweilers&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdifference-between-german-and-american-rottweilers.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdifference-between-german-and-american-rottweilers.html&title=Difference%20Between%20German%20And%20American%20Rottweilers" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdifference-between-german-and-american-rottweilers.html&title=Difference%20Between%20German%20And%20American%20Rottweilers" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdifference-between-german-and-american-rottweilers.html&title=Difference%20Between%20German%20And%20American%20Rottweilers" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdifference-between-german-and-american-rottweilers.html&description=Difference%20Between%20German%20And%20American%20Rottweilers" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./doctor-who-who-is-ruby-sunday-top-theories-hints-and-more.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Doctor Who: Who is Ruby Sunday?
