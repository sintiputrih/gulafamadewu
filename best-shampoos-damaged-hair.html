It’s also true that there is no physiological activity in the hair you see in the mirror – the base of the hair follicle, beneath the surface of the skin, is fed by blood vessels, but once hair goes beyond the surface of the scalp, it’s no longer alive.</p><p>The hair shaft is the visible part of hair that sticks out of the skin and is surrounded by the hair follicle (a sheath of skin and connective tissue).</p><h2>What causes damaged hair?</h2><p>Hair can be damaged by a variety of causes. Your hair also naturally changes in texture and dryness with the seasons, so you can expect to have some normal fluctuations in hair health throughout the course of the year. Some common causes of hair damage include:</p><h3>Hairstyling</h3><p>Hairstyling generally involves using hot tools – including hair dryers and hair straighteners. Unfortunately, these can significantly damage the keratin protein in your hair. Keratin is what makes your hair look shiny and glossy. If your hair is dull, frizzy, or breaking easily, then the likely culprit may be heat damage.</p><p>Hair dryers typically heat hair from a temperature between 80 – 140 degrees Fahrenheit. This can damage not only your hair, but your scalp too. Hair straighteners can get up to temperatures of 350 – 370 degrees Fahrenheit. There are some steps you can take though to minimize the damage caused to your hair:</p><ul><li aria-level=1>Use your hair dryer on a lower temperature (or let your hair dry naturally!)</li><li aria-level=1>Ensure your hair is completely dry before straightening</li></ul><h3>Excessive hair brushing</h3><p>As the saying goes – less is more, and this applies to brushing your hair. Brushing your hair is great for keeping your hair under control, and distributing its natural oils, but over brushing can damage the cuticle (the outside layer of the strand).</p><p>The cuticle forms the outside layer of the hair shaft, made up of scales that strengthen and protect your hair. You should aim to brush your hair once or twice per day to keep it healthy, without causing any extra damage.</p><h3>Hair ties</h3><p>Pulling your hair too tightly into a hair tie can damage it. Ideally, try to wear your hair down more often. If this isn’t possible, hair claws are another great option that cause minimal damage.</p><h3>Towels</h3><p>Unfortunately, regular towels are not designed for your delicate hair. They can contribute to split ends, and its coarse material can damage the hair shaft. A microfiber towel is much gentler on your strands than a thick cotton one and helps it to dry faster too!</p><h3>Nutrient deficiencies</h3><p>A lack of some nutrients, including vitamins A, C, D, E and B, plus zinc, iron and biotin can contribute to hair damage. Low protein can also contribute to weak or damaged hair, as it needs amino acids (the building blocks of protein), to grow properly. A calorie restricted diet can also lead to hair loss due to nutrient deficiency, or stress on your body.</p><p>You may want to check that you’re eating a varied diet to get all the nutrients your body needs. If not, changing your diet or adding a suitable vitamin supplement may help restore your hair’s natural vigor and shine.</p><h3>Stress</h3><p>Stress can be caused by many different life events, health issues, or daily stressors. Stress changes your body’s physiology – increasing cortisol and adrenaline release, resulting in that typical ‘fight or flight’ feeling.</p><p>Your hair follicles go into a ‘resting’ phase during times of stress, so they no longer produce new hair strands. As a result, you might find your hair growing less or slower than usual if you’re in a stressful phase of your life. Another side effect of stress is more scratching or pulling on the scalp, which can further result in damage.</p><p>Finding the right shampoo can make a huge difference when it comes to looking after your hair properly. To save you the time and energy, we’ve put together a list of the best shampoos available for damaged hair in 2023. These use the latest research-backed ingredients to target the root of hair damage in creative and effective ways.</p><h3>1. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Blu Atlas Shampoo</a></h3><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p>Perfect for all hair types, Blu Atlas have ticked every box with their strengthening shampoo.

These can help to supplement the action of your favorite shampoo and are often a simple ingredient that can often be found on your kitchen shelf.</p><h3>Apple cider vinegar</h3><p>Apple cider vinegar is great for hair as it balances hair and scalp pH. This makes your hair much less frizzy and promotes overall hair health.</p><p>Mix around a quarter of a cup of apple cider vinegar with two cups of water before applying to your hair. The easiest way to apply this hair treatment is by adding it to a spray bottle to evenly mist it over your scalp. Rinse out with cool water.</p><h3>Extra virgin olive oil</h3><p>Olive oil can be used to naturally stimulate the growth and health of your hair and is rich in antioxidants and antifungal properties. It can also work wonders on an irritated scalp, helping with itchiness and dandruff.</p><p>We recommend putting around one tablespoon of olive oil into your hair, massaging it in, and leaving for 30 minutes to get the best results. When washing it out, try to use lukewarm water if possible.</p><h3>Coconut oil</h3><p>Given its fatty acid content, coconut oil has been hailed as a superfood. It nourishes hair and may help to prevent protein loss – contributing to long term improvements in the health of your hair. Coconut oil is particularly good for curly hair, too.</p><p>Leaving coconut oil in your hair overnight can work wonders. You can then rinse it out in the morning with cool or warm water. This treatment can be done as often as one to three times per week.</p><h3>Banana</h3><p>Nature’s super conditioner might be part of your regular supermarket purchases! Bananas are great for hair health, helping your body to synthesize collagen due to their secret ingredient, silica. Bananas are also rich in potassium, vitamins, and natural oils that provide additional benefits to your hair’s health.</p><h3>Hair cut</h3><p>If your main concern is damaged hair ends, your best bet may be to opt for more frequent haircuts. With medium to long hair, it’s recommended to get a haircut as frequently as every eight weeks – particularly if you have chemically damaged or fraying hair ends. There’s no perfect number when it comes to how often to cut your hair, but you can also look out for some key signs. These include limp hair, split ends, or if your hair won’t hold a style.</p><h2>Frequently asked questions</h2><h3>How often should I wash my hair?</h3><p>There’s no magic answer to this question unfortunately. In general, your safe bet is to wash your hair every two to three days. Washing your hair too much results in stripping it of its natural oils, making for a dry, flaky scalp. On the other hand, washing your hair too little can lead to an itchy and irritated scalp from the buildup of dead skin cells and oil.</p><h3>How much shampoo should I apply?</h3><p>The general rule for how much shampoo to apply is around the size of a nickel. This might vary depending on the texture and density of your hair, so you can trial using different amounts and see how your hair responds.</p><p>Something else to keep in mind is where to apply shampoo. Since shampoo generally strips oils from your hair, you’ll want to focus on adding it to your scalp, rather than the ends of your hair. When you rinse it out, it will naturally glide over the rest of your hair to give it the rinse it needs. This means you can then focus on adding conditioner to the ends of your hair, which tend to be in need of more hydration.</p><h3>How long will it take to work?</h3><p>While switching to a new shampoo may result in almost immediate benefits, it can take a little while for your scalp to get completely used to it. This transition period is totally natural and your hair and scalp should come out the other side looking even better.</p><p>Still haven’t found what you’re looking for?
