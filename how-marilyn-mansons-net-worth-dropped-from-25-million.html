Due to these allegations by numerous victims, one of which being the musician's former fiancé, Evan Rachel Wood, Manson lost financial support from various companies and organizations. And since then, Manson's once massive $25 million net worth has been reduced to a mere $2.5 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Evan Rachel Wood And Jamie Bell Got Divorced Before Her Tragic Relationship With Marilyn Manson</a></span></p><p>Let's take a look at which companies have dropped Manson from their endorsement.</p><h2 id=loma-vista-recordings>Loma Vista Recordings</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar50345271.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shortly after these allegations were brought to light, Manson's label, Loma Vista Recordings, announced that they would cut ties with the musician <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">via Twitter</a>.</p><p>In light of today’s disturbing allegations by Evan Rachel Wood and other women naming Marilyn Manson as their abuser, Loma Vista will cease to further promote his current album, effective immediately. Due to these concerning developments, we have also decided not to work with Marilyn Manson on any future projects.</p><p>In addition, Manson's page has even been removed from Loma Vista's website, and they will no longer promote his most recent album, We Are Chaos. Being a hefty benefactor in Manson's income since 2015, it's clear this move dramatically affected Manson's fortune.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=creepshow>Creepshow</h2><p>Creepshow, a Shudder exclusive anthology series, was to feature an episode starring Manson in the second season. The show's creator, Greg Nicotero, made the quick decision to drop this episode from the season back in early 2021, right when Manson's abuse was first recognized. During a Television Critics Association panel, Nicotero stated, "I don’t think there was a moment where we didn’t want to do the right thing and pull the episode." In place of the cancelation, a new episode starring Molly Ringwald debuted.</p><p>The decision was made in unison with the team, showing immense support for Evan Rachel Wood and the other victims.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Dita Von Teese’s Life Has Changed Drastically Since Divorcing Marilyn Manson</a></span></p><h2 id=american-gods>American Gods</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/A7AB3BB3-E844-47A1-97E0-C9CDFFD935A1.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another show that was set to feature Manson's appearance as a recurring role was American Gods, a drama series that first debuted on Starz. In a statement released <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on Twitter</a>, Starz stated that they "stand with all victims and survivors of abuse," and that they "have decided to remove his performance from the remaining episode he is in, scheduled to air later this season."</p><p>Manson had a fairly involved role on the show, which made things quite difficult. However, efforts were made to re-edit his latest episode to remove him from it completely. American Gods actress Yetide Badaki even backed the decision in support of the women who accused Manson, saying, "I stand with Evan Rachel Wood and these brave women," in <a href=#>a tweet</a>.</p><h2 id=creative-artists-agency>Creative Artists Agency</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Manson3.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Creative Artists Agency has decided to drop Manson as well after the agency had been responsible for some of the artist's most successful runs of his music career. Manson was able to consistently rake in up to $400,000 worth of ticket sales for the last twenty years. It is worth noting that CAA also represents Evan Rachel Wood, which most likely influenced the decision for Manson to be axed.</p><p>Manson has denied all claims placed against him, but that has not stopped his exclusion from various creative projects and advocacies. Since his abuse allegations went public in 2021, the musician has gone relatively quiet. In fact, his last tweet was back in 2022 and read, "There will come a time when I can share more about the events of the past year. Until then, I’m going to let the facts speak for themselves." And his net worth continues to reflect these facts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9doq6ztcuypWalkaPAsLrSZqWerF2svLPAx2abq6egpbKlecWrpqZlYmp6rrXLpaCopl8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-marilyn-mansons-net-worth-dropped-from-25-million.html&text=How%20Marilyn%20Manson%27s%20Net%20Worth%20Dropped%20From%20%2425%20Million%20To%20%242.5%20Million&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-marilyn-mansons-net-worth-dropped-from-25-million.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-marilyn-mansons-net-worth-dropped-from-25-million.html&title=How%20Marilyn%20Manson%27s%20Net%20Worth%20Dropped%20From%20%2425%20Million%20To%20%242.5%20Million" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-marilyn-mansons-net-worth-dropped-from-25-million.html&title=How%20Marilyn%20Manson%27s%20Net%20Worth%20Dropped%20From%20%2425%20Million%20To%20%242.5%20Million" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-marilyn-mansons-net-worth-dropped-from-25-million.html&title=How%20Marilyn%20Manson%27s%20Net%20Worth%20Dropped%20From%20%2425%20Million%20To%20%242.5%20Million" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-marilyn-mansons-net-worth-dropped-from-25-million.html&description=How%20Marilyn%20Manson%27s%20Net%20Worth%20Dropped%20From%20%2425%20Million%20To%20%242.5%20Million" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./k-pop-stars-plastic-surgery.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="K-Pop Stars Before And After Plastic Surgery">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./gofundme-eric-bonilla-jr-died-in-i-90-car-accident.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="GoFundMe; Eric Bonilla Jr. died in I-90 car accident">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
