He shares the same parents as his sister, June White, and Arthur White.</p><p>After failing the 11-plus in 1951, Jason attended Northfield Secondary Modern School while residing in Lodge Lane, North Finchley.</p><p>Jason was inspired by his brother to pursue acting after graduation, but their father suggested that he first study a trade. He received six years of electrical training before giving up and pursuing acting.</p><p>The 1933-born actor Arthur White is Jason’s older brother. In the crime thriller A Touch of Frost, where Arthur portrayed police archivist Ernie Trigg, the two made another appearance together. In the comic fant asy The Colour of Magic, which was released in 2008, Arthur portrayed a character by the name of “Rerpf.”</p><p>In two episodes of The Darling Buds of May, he and his brother made a brief appearance together as well.</p><p>Jason worked as a mechanic’s assistant for a year when he was 15 years old. He had the option to sign up for an apprenticeship when he turned 16 but opted not to.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>David Jason career</h2><p>In 1964, Jason made his acting debut on television in Crossroads as Bert Bradshaw. He costarred alongside Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Denise Coffey, and Michael Palin in the children’s comedy series Do Not Adjust Your Set (Rediffusion London/ITV) in 1967 as the parody super-hero Captain Fantastic, among other roles.</p><p>Jason was chosen to appear in Do Not Adjust Your Set by Humphrey Barclay, who loved his timing. Jason was chosen partially to contrast Idle, Jones, and Palin’s more sophisticated aesthetic.</p><p>After the show’s finale in 1969, the character briefly appeared in the Thames Television children’s show Magpie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/14112435/0_JS115144003.webp?resize=615%2C408&ssl=1"><p>In 1967, Jason made an appearance in the BBC comedy series Hugh and I, which starred Hugh Lloyd and Terry Scott as two South London neighbors.</p><p>He played Abel, a framed actor in a well-known London theater, in the Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) episode “That’s How Murder Snowballs” (1969).</p><p>Jason was initially cast in the 1968 Jimmy Perry and David Croft BBC comedy Dad’s Army as Lance Corporal Jones. The actor had left a lasting impression on Croft, who recognized that he had the skill to portray a character who was considerably older than his actual age.</p><p>He also appeared in radio comedy during the 1970s, such as The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy (as the “B Ark Captain” in the sixth episode) and the weekly topical satire Week Ending, in which he frequently played characters like the then-UK Foreign Secretary Dr. David Owen.</p><p>Additionally, Jason made an appearance on The Next Programme Follows Almost Immediately, his own series, The Jason Explanation, and panel shows like The Impressionists. He had an appearance in Mostly Monkhouse in the early 1970s.</p><p>In the 1973 comedy No Sex Please, We’re British, Jason played Brian Runnicles for 18 months on stage in the West End. He also appeared in the 1975 theatrical comedy “Darling Mr. London” alongside Valerie Leon.</p><p>Ronnie Barker became interested in Jason’s performances when he supported Dick Emery on variety shows.</p><p>In Hark at Barker (LWT, 1969), Jason was cast as Dithers, the 100-year-old gardener, facing Barker’s Lord Rustless.</p><p>A follow-up, His Lordship Entertains, aired on the BBC in 1972. In the opening episode of the comedy anthology Seven of One (1973), named Open All Hours (BBC), starred Barker as the cynical owner of a corner shop, and Jason as optimistic employee Granville.</p><p>Jason played the lead role in Terence Frisby and Humphrey Barclay’s Lucky Feller (1975–76) for London Weekend Television.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/14112432/methode_times_prod_web_bin_c1e146e8-be22-11eb-8144-d3653cd81e51-1024x1024.jpg><p>The show, which followed two brothers in south-east London, was in many ways a precursor to Only Fools And Horses; however, Peter Armitage played the smarter of the two brothers while Jason played the more lovable ‘Rodney’ part.</p><p>There was even a joke where, as Jason was trying to impress the girl (Cheryl Hall), he casually leaned back against the bar without realizing the bartender had just lifted it behind his back and fell through.</p><p>The brothers drove around in a humorous bubble car, a forerunner to the well-known Trotters’ van. Only Fools And Horses reenacted this scenario.</p><p>In the ATV sitcom A Sharp Intake of Breath (1977–1981), he costarred with Alun Armstrong and Richard Wilson as Peter Barnes, the show’s protagonist.</p><p>He played Buttons in the pantomime Cinderella at Newcastle’s Theatre Royal in 1979, which was produced by Michael Grayson and directed by John Blackmore and starred Leah Bell and Bobby Thompson.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How much is David Jason worth?</h2><p>David Jason has a net worth estimated to be about $10 million approximately as of 2023.</p><p><strong>Source:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">www.Ghgossip.com</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jp2Yr6GUYreiv86nZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdavid-jason-net-worth.html&text=David%20Jason%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20Much%20Is%20David%20Jason%20Worth%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdavid-jason-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdavid-jason-net-worth.html&title=David%20Jason%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20Much%20Is%20David%20Jason%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdavid-jason-net-worth.html&title=David%20Jason%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20Much%20Is%20David%20Jason%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdavid-jason-net-worth.html&title=David%20Jason%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20Much%20Is%20David%20Jason%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdavid-jason-net-worth.html&description=David%20Jason%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20Much%20Is%20David%20Jason%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ethan-deneault.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ethan Deneault Archives - 247 News Around The World">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./are-rae-and-jake-still-together-the-ultimatum.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Are Rae and Jake Still Together After 'The Ultimatum: Marry or Move on'?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
