From his sexuality being the topic of discussion in the press to his divorce from ex-husband Jeff Leatham, the actor has definitely been acquainted with the dark side of being a celebrity. Haynes came out as gay publicly in 2016, and has since been open about his struggles in Hollywood. The actor released his memoir Miss Memory Lane, where he opens about his complicated journey with abuse, drugs and addiction throughout his career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But Haynes' life has changed for the better with the actor scoring roles on the CW's Arrow, American Horror Story and even being set to reprise his role as Jackson Whittemore in the upcoming Teen Wolf: The Movie.

Fans of Haynes know that his friends are an integral part of the actor's journey, and he is not shy about letting the world know about them.
