And as soon as I heard him sing, I stopped dead in my tracks. I knew he could play a rock star. Actually, he’s the only actor on the planet who could play this one.”</p><p>Lady Gaga went on to praise her co-star over how much he saw in her.

Because they were dating other people at the time, they did everything they could to keep it on the down-low. If the rumors stand true, then Lady Gaga allegedly fell much harder than Cooper did for her.That mysterious creature, "an unnamed" source said Gaga thought&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cooper could be "the one</a>". &nbsp;However, it doesn't stop there! Supposedly, she thought he felt the same way too. The source went on to spill the beans: “Lady Gaga fell head over heels for Bradley during filming and promotion of A Star is Born."<span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here's How Bradley Cooper Was Able To Relate To His 'A Star Is Born' Character</a></span><h2>Could It Have All Been For Publicity?</h2>[EMBED_INSTA]https://www.instagram.com/p/BucFbLchv6z/[/EMBED_INSTA]Despite the rumors, the faces of A Star Is Born, Gaga and Bradley made it clear that there is no truth behind any of them.
