The English actress was born in Oxford to Deborah and Clinton Pugh. Her mother was a dancer, so Pugh was no stranger to showmanship, while her father ran restaurants.

The two actresses play school girls and best friends whose lives are completely changed after a tragedy. Afterwards, she has been on a prolific, diverse and illustrious movie journey on films like Lady Macbeth and Outlaw King till she had her breakout role in Midsommar. As a young and upcoming actress, <a href=#>she made all the right moves by prioritizing her range and proving all her chops and capabilities very early on in her career</a>, while other actors may focus on just getting famous fast.</p><h2 id=she-39-s-a-strong-advocate-women-in-the-industry-and-for-women-in-general><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>She's A Strong Advocate Women In The Industry, And For Women In General</span></h2><p>More often than not, actors rejoice at the idea of acting in movies that represent their ideals. When Pugh got to star in Little Women, she fans could see it in her eyes that she was passionate about this film's message. Additionally, Pugh always offers support to her peers, she even shared Zendaya's Emmy win as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the two stars are currently filming a project together.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Olivia Wilde Says Pay Disparity Between Harry Styles And Florence Pugh Is 'Nonexistent'">Olivia Wilde Says Pay Disparity Between Harry Styles And Florence Pugh Is 'Nonexistent'</a></span></p><h2 id=her-acting-range-is-a-force-to-be-reckoned-with><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Her Acting Range Is A Force To Be Reckoned With</span></h2><p>From horror to drama to period pieces and action, Florence Pugh has done basically all.

She was only six years old when she participated in her first ever theatrical work: she played Mary in her school's nativity play. Growing up, the actress often posted videos of her singing, and disliked her private school simply because it did not add anything to her acting passion. So, one could say, it's been a long relationship between Pugh and the limelight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-still-has-so-much-ahead-of-her><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>She Still Has So Much Ahead Of Her</span></h2><p>Fans often forget that Pugh is only 24, turning 25 this January.
