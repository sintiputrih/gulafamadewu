According to his sister Brittany, his mother was “A rare, rare find, Elizabeth embodied many different things to different people—mother and child, strength and weakness, humor and hurt, piety and villainess—but she was always beautiful and unfiltered”.</p><p>Elizabeth had Noah from her relationship with Chris Thompson. She had him on 18 April 2002. That makes him 20 years old as of 2022.</p><p>Before Noah, she married Scott Ambrose. She shared two daughters with him; Britany Miller Dawson and Alexandria Kyle Ambrose.</p><p>Son of Kenneth and Sharon Ambrose, Scott was regarded as a musical genius. He was passionate about guitar and loved the odd time signatures and unreal technical ability of progressive rock in the vein of Rush and Yes, along with genre-bending bluegrass/jazz/funk styling of bands like Bela Fleck and the Flecktones.</p><p>Furthermore, he was a master of classical guitar and could pick out a Fernando Sor piece or translate something from Back onto the fretboard just as easily and beautifully as running down an Alex Lifeson riff.</p><p>Scott had died of a blood clot in his lung just after turning 32 years old.</p><p>Scott was the brother of Dr. Paul Ambrose and was a passenger on American Airlines Flight 77 that was flown into the Pentagon during the 9/11 incident.</p><h3><strong>Elizabeth Miller Cause Of Death</strong></h3><p>According to Noah’s sister Britany Miller, Elizabeth suffered extensive brain damage which became the cause of her death. She had successive complications so they had to make the difficult decision to take her off of life support. She was hospitalized after cardiac arrest.</p><p>Elizabeth took her last breath surrounded by her daughter Alexandria. Her boyfriend Tony was also by her side holding her right hand.</p><h3><strong>Elizabeth Miller Age At The Time Of Her Death</strong></h3><p>Born on 7 October 1967, and died on 6 May 2018, Elizabeth Miller was 50 years old at the time of her death.</p><h3><strong>What Did Elizabeth Miller Do For A Living?</strong></h3><p>Elizabeth Miller loved music and people remembered her as a doting mother. However, when it comes to her career not much appears in the public domain.</p><h3><strong>Elizabeth Miller Parents</strong></h3><p>Elizabeth Miller was born to her mother Kappy Johnson. According to Elizabeth’s sister’s Facebook post, Kappy was a sweet soul who allegedly raised her children all on her own. According to the FB status from May 2020, Kappy sailed the Caribbean in her own sailboat.</p><p>She wrote, “my mom and i.. she was amazing.. sailed the Caribbean in her own sailboat, hung out with the Marley family in jamaica.. they loved her.. everyone did.. the way she looked was the way she was.. to everyone! she was a seer.. a very deep lady… she saw things others are still blind to”.</p><p>Before Elizabeth died, she was taking care of her mother.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Was Elizabeth Miller From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Elizabeth Miller hailed from Kentucky, United States.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Did Elizabeth Miller Leave Behind Any Sibling?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Elizabeth Miller was the youngest of three daughters born to her parents.
