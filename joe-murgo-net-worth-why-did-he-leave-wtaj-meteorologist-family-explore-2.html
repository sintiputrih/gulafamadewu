He started working at WTAJ-TV as the chief meteorologist in 2006. The media is currently abuzz with rumors about his retirement. Is this a fact? Since 1995, Joe Murgo has worked as a meteorologist for regional media.</strong></p><p>Additionally, he has experience in operational forecasting, teaching, consulting, and the fields of climate and climate change. After graduating, Murgo went on to work at AccuWeather in State College as a Senior Meteorologist.&nbsp; Joe, on the other hand, became one of the nation’s and Pennsylvania’s first meteorologists (AMS) in 2005 after earning the designation of Certified Broadcast Meteorologist from the American Meteorological Society.</p><p>Later, he joined the WTOV-TV forecasting crew in Steubenville, Ohio. Before coming back to WTAJ to take charge of the weather division, Joe most recently worked at WUSA-TV, the CBS station in The Nation’s Capital. He is now WTAJ-TV 2006’s chief meteorologist.</p><h2><span id=When_Joe_Murgo_departs_from_WTAJ_where_will_he_go_Retirement_rumors>When Joe Murgo departs from WTAJ, where will he go? Retirement rumors</span></h2><p>There are currently media rumors floating concerning Joe Murgo’s retirement. He hasn’t spoken anything in public about this knowledge, though. When Casey was getting ready to retire, Joe joined WTAJ-TV in 2006 and worked alongside him. Murgo praised Casey’s communication skills and his exceptional ability to communicate via television, qualities he hopes to instill in aspiring meteorologists.</p><p>In 1990, Murgo graduated from Penn State with a degree in meteorology. He then worked for AccuWeather in State College, WTOV-TV in Ohio, and WUSA-TV in Washington, DC before taking the position of Chief Meteorologist at WTAJ-TV in Central Pennsylvania.</p><p>He was chosen to serve on the Board of Broadcast Meteorology of the American Meteorology Society in 2012. He assisted in introducing the CBM seals to other professionals. Not to mention that he is a member of the National Weather Association’s Professional Development Committee and currently serving a second term on the AMS Board of broadcast meteorology.</p><h2><span id=How_Much_Does_Joe_Murgo_Have_in_the_Bank>How Much Does Joe Murgo Have in the Bank?</span></h2><p>Joe’s earnings, investments, and other assets all make up his estimated <strong>$2 million</strong> net worth. His work as a meteorologist is his primary source of income. Joe has always wished that people could learn about the weather through television. He decided to move out of Pennsylvania in October 1995 to follow his goals.</p><p>He started working as a forecaster for WTOV-TV in Steubenville, Ohio. Before going back to WTAJ to take charge of the weather division, Joe worked at WUSA-TV, the CBS station in The Nation’s Capital. Joe accomplished a clean sweep of all attainable standards for television meteorologists in 2008 by receiving the National Weather Association’s Television Seal of Approval.</p><p>He has won a number of more awards both inside and beyond the broadcast industry. In 2009, Joe was chosen to serve on the Board of Broadcast Meteorology of the American Meteorology Society.</p><h2><span id=Family_Murgo>Family Murgo</span></h2><p>Joe Murgo was raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma after his parents moved there from Brooklyn, New York, where he was born. His parents supported him in pursuing his goal of becoming an accomplished meteorologist. He wed his lovely wife Mara, and the two will commemorate their 29th wedding anniversary on June 16, 2020, according to Facebook.</p><p>His family includes the couple’s two children, Kristen and Rebecca, as well as AJ and AJ, two golden retrievers. The dog belongs to the couple as well. J enjoys a range of neighborhood activities and goes skiing in the winter.
