The show wrapped up its production in New Zealand in June 2021. The film was produced by Scott Frank, co-creator of The Queen’s Gambit. Whereas, the show was written by Andrew Barrer and Gabriel Ferrari.</p><p>The movie tells of a young woman named Darby (played by actress Havana Rose Liu) stuck with a group of people at a mountain rest top during a blizzard.

In falling in love with her, it just felt like, “Oh, I want to do this part, even if it’s terrifying.” The journey she goes on, spiritually in a way, is even more important than me [having] to get over my fear of fear.”</p><p>Havana also shared that since her character was an addict she did the research for the character.
