Who is he? What does she do for a living? Where is he from?</p><p>Learn all that we know about him as this article proceeds.</p><h3><strong>Meet Kareem Hawthorne, Claim To Fame Star Morgan Monay Harvey Husband</strong></h3><p>Kareem Dj-Bruckup Hawthorne and Morgan Monay Harvey wedded on October 12, 2013. Two of them reportedly engaged on 27 January 2013.</p><p>The two met while in college at Spelman circa 2006 and began a serious relationship after graduation. It appears like Morgan and Kareem, who are joined in their lives together by their two daughters, are truly loving it.</p><p>Morgan posted some old photos from her wedding day to Instagram on their tenth wedding anniversary in 2022 and gushed over their trip. She spoke extensively on their commitment to both the voyage and one another.</p><p>After spending an evening with friends skipping through an entire 300-card meme game because its content was so ‚Äúwack,‚Äù husband-and-wife team&nbsp;Morgan and Kareem Hawthorne decided they needed to create a game for the culture, by the culture.</p><p>‚ÄúIt was a cool concept, but it didn‚Äôt resonate with me and my friends,‚Äù Morgan told <a href=#>Atlanta Black Star</a> in an exclusive interview. ‚ÄúSo we were like we need this for us. That was the moment when we were like, ‚ÄòYo, we can do this. We can make it dope and we can make it Black culture inspired.‚Äô Game night means a lot in our culture. We have so much personality and we always put a twist on things.‚Äù</p><p>On Father‚Äôs Day 2022, Morgan wished her husband, ‚ÄúHappy Father‚Äôs Day to Elle and Marley‚Äôs daddy and my incredible partner. Thank you for always leading our household with vision, love, diligence, patience, and tenderness. I love watching you grow in your role as a wonderful ‚ÄúGirl Dad‚Äù. We love you so much and celebrate you as the best dad in our world every day. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è <a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz notranslate _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>@djbruckup</a>.‚Äù</p><p>In June 2020, on Kareem‚Äôs birthday, Morgam wished her husband, ‚ÄúHappy 35th Birthday to the man that holds my heart! You should be so proud of all that you‚Äôve accomplished over the years of your life. I know I am. I‚Äôm so blessed to love you and make even more beautiful memories for another year. You make all my days sweeter! Enjoy your special day! ‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞.‚Äù</p><p>Morgan recently appeared in season 2 of Claim To Fame.</p><p>When introducing herself on Claim To Fame, Morgan Monay Harvey claimed her celebrity relative is her father and that he is best known for being an athlete. She also hinted that her famed father has an Emmy Award. And some of the contestants did guess right that she is none other than Steve Harvey‚Äôs daughter, mostly because of her striking likeness to the Little Big Shots&nbsp;star. Morgan also had gushed that the last thing her celebrity relative had told her was to ‚ÄúBring home the money‚Äù.</p><p>Morgan claimed that lying is her technique and that she lies about anything and everything in the ‚ÄúTwo Truths and a Lie‚Äù segment. Carly told Hugo and Travis that she thought Morgan resembled Steve Harvey and that he might be her father when it was Hugo‚Äôs turn to be the guesser. He has supposedly been on television forever and has most likely received an Emmy.</p><p>In each episode of Claim To Fame, one contestant is eliminated and only then their identity is revealed. Meanwhile, the last person standing takes home a hefty prize of $100,000.</p><p>Season 2 got off to an exciting start as Morgan Monay Harvey and the other contestants made their way to the Claim to Fame mansion. They had their first introduction to the clue wall filled with items such as a green bench, a bee, a mask, a rhino, and an astronaut.</p><h3><strong>Morgan Monay And Kareem Hawthrone Children</strong></h3><p>Their eldest, Elle, AKA&nbsp;Barbie Girl, and Sugar Bear, turned 8 on 27 March 2023.</p><p>Their second daughter Marley completed 2 on 1 September 2022. ‚ÄúYou have brought a spunk and lighthearted air to our family that was right on time. We are in love with your fire, your humor, your fearlessness, your wonder‚Äù, Morgan gushed about her sweet baby on that day.</p><h3><strong>Kareem Hawthorne Age</strong></h3><p>Born in June 1985, Kareem Hawthorne is 38 years old in 2023.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Kareem Hawthorne Parents?</strong></h3><p>Kareem Hawthorne is the grandson of Hyacinth Merlyn Hawthorne. She was born on 23 February 1929 and passed away on 12 December 2021.</p><p>Hyacinth‚Äôs life spanned Jamaica, England, and the USA.</p><p>Other family members of Kareem include Kahiel Hawthorne (age 40), Clive Hawthorne (age 66), and Khadary Hawthorne (age 28).</p><h3><strong>Kareem Hawthorne Job</strong></h3><p>Kareem Hawthorne is a business owner, namely a company T-12 Entertainment Corporation. He incorporated the company in September 2008. OpenCorporates listed him as an agent, CEO, secretary, and CFO.</p><p>In 2016, Kareem was accused of scamming&nbsp;Morehouse & Spelman College alumni out close to $300,000 during their homecoming party.</p><p>DJ BRUCKUP and his T-12 Entertainment company, in charge of hosting this year‚Äôs party at Atlanta‚Äôs Georgia Aquarium, were allegedly charging partygoers upwards of $4,000 for VIP packages that were supposed to include sections equipped with couches and bottles but were greeted with ‚Äúwatered down‚Äù cups of liquor and IKEA futons.</p><p>BruckUp also promised that patrons would be able to enjoy a night of ‚Äúpartying with the sharks‚Äù as the aquarium was to serve as a backdrop but the DJ was allegedly playing hits from the early 2000s from his laptop with a Beats Pill and the venue was pitch black with no light illuminating the fish tanks.</p><p>Even crazier, ‚ÄúBruckUp‚Äù allegedly left the Aquarium party early and went to another function to celebrate the heist of the century popping bottles with his whole T-12 team.</p><p>Many in attendance are threatening to sue if they aren‚Äôt reimbursed for false advertisement, but BruckUp has no intentions of returning the almost 300 racks that he collected Joanne the Scammer style. So until Hawthorne addresses the party, SpelHouse is trolling him on social media.</p><p>One of the main benefits of a party at the Georgia Aquarium is the ability to see some of the incredible exhibits of sea life at the facility. But according to witnesses, the exhibits and hallways were darkened. Instead of a night featuring a live DJ, partygoers claimed that the DJ was playing out-of-date hits from a laptop with a Beats Pill&nbsp;amplifier speaker.</p><p>Reportedly, Kareem left the event early and went to a hipper party that night. Now the event is being called #Aquagate and attendees are threatening to sue Hawthorne and have taken him to task on social media.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Kareem Hawthorne Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Kareem Hawthorne‚Äôs net worth is above $2 million.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Kareem Hawthorne From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Kareem Hawthorne is residing in Atlanta, Georgia.
