He previously played for HC Dynamo Moscow of the Russian Superleague, but all of his efforts have helped put his net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Alexander Ovechkin? As of early-2017, sources estimate a net worth that is at $60 million, mostly earned through success in ice hockey; he reportedly earns a current salary of $9 million annually. He’s won numerous awards and has a lot of recognition for his achievements. As he continues his career it is expected that his wealth will also continue to increase.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=alexander-ovechkin-net-worth-60-million></span>Alexander Ovechkin Net Worth $60 million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>At a young age, Alexander was already interested in hockey and watched the sport a lot; he was athletic and played various sports during his youth. Eventually, he was officially introduced to hockey though he didn’t play much because he didn’t have a lot of time to go to a rink.</p><p>When he was 16 years old, he joined Dynamo Moscow as part of the Russian Super League (RSL). He made his debut in the 2001 to 2002 season, and would continue to play there for the next three seasons before being drafted to the NHL in 2004, when he joined the NHL Entry Draft and was selected as first overall by the Washington Capitals – he had already been considered as the top pick for the past two years. The 2004 to 2005, the NHL lockout meant that he could play with Dynamo for one more season, winning a championship. He also played in the 2005 World Junior Championships and the team won gold. With the threat of another lockout looming, he signed with Avangard Omsk, but had an ‘out’ clause with the team, so eventually he returned to the Capitals and his net worth would then start to increase significantly.</p><p>In 2006, Alexander scored his first hat trick in the NHL, which certainly got him a lot of notice. He became the third player to be named the NHL Rookie of the Month and the Offensive Player of the Month, and at the end of his rookie season he led in several categories among rookies; he became the first rookie to receive the NHL First All-Star Team honor in 15 years, and was also awarded the Calder Memorial Trophy. After his rookie season, Ovechkin was given a 13-year $123 million contract which boosted his net worth to a very high point, being the richest contract in NHL history. He would score 60 goals in his second season, and would lead the league in scoring, so earning the Art Ross Trophy and the Maurice “Rocket” Richard Trophy. The team made it to the Stanley Cup playoffs, but they were eliminated in the opening round.</p><p>Alexander reached his 200th goal in his fourth season making him the fourth player in NHL to ever do so, and captured a second consecutive Rocket Richard Trophy, but during the playoffs they were defeated by the eventual Stanley Cup champions, the Pittsburgh Penguins. In 2010, he would become the captain of the Washington Capitals, and would win the Ted Lindsay Award, and he became the first player in NHL history to be voted as a First Team All-Star in each of his first five seasons. In the next two years, Ovechkin’s numbers started to dip, though he returned to form in 2013. He continued to break records in the next few years including the franchise record of 825 points. He would also become the third player in NHL History to have seven or more 50 goal seasons. They would reach the 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs, but would again lose to the Pittsburgh Penguins.</p><p>For his personal life, it is known that Alexander is married to Nastya Shubskaya. He was previously engaged to tennis player Maria Kirilenko, but their wedding was called off. He is also a car enthusiast and owns several luxury cars, including a Mercedes-Benz SL65 AMG Black Series and a Mercedes S63 AMG.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><table><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Alexander Ovechkin</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$60 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>$9 million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>September 17, 1985</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Moscow, Russia</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 ft 2 in (1.9 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>234 lbs (106 kg)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Ice hockey player</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Russian</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Alena Semina</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Alexander Alexandrovich Semin</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Mikhail Ovechkin, Tatyana Ovechkina</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Sergei Ovechkin, Mikhael Ovechkin</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>alexander_ovechkin , Alexander Mikhaylovich Ovechkin , Alex Ovechkin</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td>https://twitter.com/ovi8</td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td>https://www.instagram.com/aleksandrovechkinofficial/</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2307140/</td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>Hart Memorial Trophy, Maurice “Rocket” Richard Trophy, Calder Memorial Trophy, Art Ross Trophy, Ted Lindsay Award</td></tr><tr><td>Nominations</td><td>Mark Messier Leadership Award, Best NHL Player ESPY Award, Best Play ESPY Award, Best Breakthrough Athlete ESPY Award</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts><tr><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Signed a 13-year, $124 million dollar contract extension with the Washington Capitals in 2008, the first $100 million dollar deal in NHL history.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>NHL records (as of 2010-2011) include: most goals (65) scored by a left winger in a season (2007-2008), most points (106) scored by a left wing rookie (2005-2006), most regular-season points (106) by a Russian-born rookie.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>His father, Mikhail Ovechkin, was a professional soccer player, and his mother, Tatyana Ovechkina, won gold medals with the Soviet women’s basketball team in the 1976 and 1980 Summer Olympics, respectively.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Has an older brother, Mikhael.
