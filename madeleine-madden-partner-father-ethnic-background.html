But among them, Madeleine Madden who portrayed Egwene al’Vere was getting a little more attention than the others.</span></p><p><span>Thus, here we are to answer all the questions about Madeleine’s partner, father, and ethnic background.</span></p><h3><b>Does Madeleine Madden Have A Partner?</b></h3><p><span>No, Madeleine Madden didn’t seem like she had a partner as of 2021. We believe that she was still healing from her relationship of over 2 years with her ex-boyfriend Jack Rule at the time.</span></p><p><span>The first we ever saw Madeleine and her ex-boyfriend was over her IG picture dated December 8, 2016. Captioned “sandy bums”, Madeleine was captured in the arms of Jack over the photo.</span></p><p><span>Since then, the two went on to make regular appearances on Madeleine’s social. Her followers saw them anywhere from sleeping on the couch on Valentine’s day to enjoying out on Haleiwa food truckers.</span></p><p><span>As for as we know, Madeleine and her then-boyfriend Jack loved traveling. They’ve been to Vietnam and a few other places around the world. On their trip to Vietnam in Nov 2017, Madeleine took it to her IG to share their pic captioned, “Another day of hiking and squealing at buffalos rolling in the mud.”</span></p><p><span>Little info about Jack — He hosted a radio show called “Camel” on Orbital Radio every Wednesday from 5 pm – 7 pm, alongside co-host&nbsp; Joe and Baker. They brought “the smooth tunes each hump day playing funk, indie, house, disco and more from all around the world.”</span></p><p><span>The last we saw the pair was back on Valentine’s day 2018. We have no information on how the two broke up.</span></p><p><span>For those of you wondering if she ever had a kid. No, Madeleine didn’t have any children as of 2021.</span></p><h3><b>Madeleine Madden Ethnic Background</b></h3><p><span>Madeleine Madden is of Aboriginal Australian ethnic background. However, she is also part German, Irish, and English.</span></p><p><span>This Australian actress was readying herself for stardom in 2021 all set to appear in </span><i><span>The Wheel of Time</span></i><span>. Being thrust into something so grand, Madeleine shared that it was “incredible”, but also scary at the same time. “Egwene’s journey is a little bit more traumatic than what I’ve gone through, it’s been wonderful for me. But I related to the fact that like Egwene, my world changed almost overnight,” she related to her character.</span></p><p><span>Her co-start in the inaugural season were Rosamund Pike (Moiraine Damodred), <a href=#>Daniel Henney</a> (Lan Mondragoran), Josha Stradowski (Rand al’Thor), Marcus Rutherford (Perrin Aybara), Zoë Robins (Nynaeve al’Meara), and Barney Harris (Mat Cauthon).</span></p><h3><b>Who Was Madeleine Madden Father, Lee Madden?</b></h3><p><span>Madeleine Madden’s father Lee Madden was the first Aboriginal school captain at </span><i><span>Cleveland Street Boys High School</span></i><span> in Surry Hills. He first started his tennis career when he was 14 right after he was given a tennis racket by the famous NSW “Black Santa”, “Doc” Cunningham.</span></p><p><span>Fast forward to 1983, he became the first Aboriginal person to win a scholarship at the </span><i><span>Australian Institute of Sport</span></i><span>, all thanks to his previous coach Canberra-based tennis player, Charlie Hollis.</span></p><p><span>Unfortunately, Madeleine’s father, Lee passed away tragically in a car accident in 2003. He was working with the Metropolitan Land Council at the time.</span></p><p><span>After his death, Madeleine was raised solely by her mother Hetti Perkins who was an art curator and writer. “Growing up in a single-mother household, I just feel so blessed. Mum’s passed on so much insight and wisdom and love and acceptance to us that I felt like whatever I could come to her with, I would be accepted,” she shared.</span></p><p><span>Talking about her mother,&nbsp; Hetti worked as a senior cultural advisor on numerous national and international art projects including AGNSW between 1989-2011. She has also curated major survey exhibitions of Indigenous art like one of Australia’s representations at the Venice Biennale of 1997.</span></p><p><b>Trivia:</b><span> Madeleine’s paternal grandparents were Lily and Charles Madden. Also, she is the great-granddaughter of Hetty and Charles Perkins,</span></p><h3><b>How Many Siblings Does Madeleine Madden Have?</b></h3><p><span>Madeleine Madden has 5 siblings, three biological and two half-siblings.</span></p><p><span>Her biological siblings are — sisters Lille @</span><a href=#><span>lillemadden</span></a><span> and Thea @</span><a href=#><span>anamara_art</span></a><span>, and an older brother Tyson @</span><a href=#><span>tysonfperkinsdp</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>As for her step-siblings, they are Miah @</span><a href=#><span>miahmadden</span></a><span> and Ruby @</span><a href=#><span>rubymadden_</span></a><span>. They were brought up by their mum, Belinda (Madeleine’s stepmother).</span></p><h3><b>Madeleine Madden Height</b></h3><p><span>Madeleine Madden stands tall at a height of 5 feet 6 inches (167 cm).</span></p><p><span>Her distinct features include — dark hair, dark eyes, and a mole on her nose as well as on her above-lip (both left sides).</span></p><h3><b>Madeleine Madden Net Worth</b></h3><p><span>Madeleine Madden garnered a net worth of above $1 million by 2021.</span></p><p><span>This actress first came to Australia’s attention at 13 as she delivered an address to the nation, broadcast on all free-to-air and pay-TV networks about Indigenous disadvantage. Soon after her career took off. She then went on to land roles on TV series like </span><i><span>Ready for This</span></i><span> (2015), Tomorrow, When the War Began (2016), Mystery Road (2018), Tidelands (2018), and many more.</span></p><p><span>Though she is a star now, Madeleine never left activism behind.
