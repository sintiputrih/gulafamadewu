One of the most memorable rumors is that Swift and <strong><a href=#>Olivia Munn</a> </strong>don't like each other.

Since Kanye West famously interrupted Swift at the 2009 MTV Video Awards, Munn was alluding to that and later said it was meant to be funny.</p><p>People might have expected Swift and Munn to admit to a feud after this awards show moment.
