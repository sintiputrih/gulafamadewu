All it does is make money, with 42 million viewers and annual cash flow of $150 million.</p><p>With $25 million to spend, Diller has become a partner in QVC with&nbsp;Time Warner Inc.,&nbsp;Comcast Inc., and Liberty Media, which is a spinoff of Tele-Communications Inc., the nation`s largest cable franchise company. In short, Diller is in business with the guys who run the business.</p><p>As viewers looking at the prospect of a cable universe expected to expand to 500 channels, the best we can hope for QVC-and its share of that cable market-is that Diller will use the network`s reach and resources to make it more of a real entertainment outlet or at least more than just another televised swap meet. There are signs he will get that chance.</p><p>Liberty announced a few days before Diller`s purchase late last week that it was buying control of Home Shopping Network, QVC`s larger rival, for $152 million, and there are those who think the two shop-at-home services eventually will merge. HSN reaches 68 million viewers. A merger would free up QVC to be used for other purposes.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=barry-diller-net-worth></span><span>Barry Diller Net worth</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He has enjoyed a long career in the business industry.
