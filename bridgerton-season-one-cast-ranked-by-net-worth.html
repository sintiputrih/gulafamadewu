Thomas spoke with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">F***ing Young</a> about his passion for acting in January 2022, saying, “I spent more time pretending to be fictional characters than being myself. My parents took me to amateur theatre groups where I started to perform in local productions. I was spotted in a show by an agent who sent me to my first audition. I booked that job and it soon became clear that it was specifically acting that I wanted to focus on moving forward.”</p><p data-characters=564 data-current-count=564 data-injectable=true>When the outlet asked him what he would do instead of acting, he responded by saying that he’d probably be a singer. He said, “I grew up listening to Elvis with my Nan. I spent a lot of time singing and still use my voice from time to time — I do so in the last episode of Bridgerton. Acting has always been my main passion but I’d love to combine the two and play a singer at some point.” It’s not surprising at all that he’s accumulated a net worth of $2.5 million based on how talented he is across-the-board. His stage presence is undeniable.</p><h3 id=ben-miller-plays-archibald-featherington-and-has-a-net-worth-of-5-million data-injectable=false>Ben Miller plays Archibald Featherington and has a net worth of $5 million</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ben Miller (@actualbenmiller)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=613 data-current-count=913 data-injectable=true>Archibald Featherington is played by Ben Miller, who currently has a net worth of $5 million.

He started acting back in 1986 and has been part of over 71 projects since then. It doesn’t seem that Miller will be slowing down anytime soon, with his net worth consistently growing as he continues to star in movies and TV shows.

She started acting at the age of 14 and stuck with it to the point of landing the leading role in <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bridgerton</a></strong>. This Netflix show has certainly put her on the map and made her one of the most recognizable faces in television today.</p><p data-characters=705 data-current-count=705 data-injectable=false>When speaking about playing the role of Daphne, Dynevor told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">W Magazine,</a> “Being able to do a role where you learn a new skill is just such a dream. I recently played a potter and got to learn pottery. For Daphne, it’s terrible, because I really wanted to learn how to play piano, but then the pandemic happened, so I never got around to it. Which sounds silly, because you can easily learn from home. I had so much free time.” Even though Dynevor didn’t actually learn how to play piano to execute the role of Daphne, she brought out the acting skills to make it look believable enough in each episode of the show.
