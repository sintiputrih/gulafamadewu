While at Duke, Battier was often the best defender on the court. He frequently took charges which prompted the&nbsp;Cameron Crazies&nbsp;to chant, “Who’s your daddy? Battier!” He led the&nbsp;Duke Blue Devils men’s basketball&nbsp;to two&nbsp;Final Fours, in 1999 and 2001, though his team in 1998 squandered a late 17-point lead to eventual national champion Kentucky in the regional finals.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=shane-battier-family></span>Shane Battier Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He was born from a black father and a white mother.

He averaged 13.6 points, 6.1 rebounds, 1.8 steals and 1.7 blocks per game during his four years with the Blue Devils and his No. 31 jersey hanging in the rafters at Cameron Indoor Stadium.</p><p>After a 13-year NBA career that featured two championship rings with the Miami Heat, Battier is now the Heat’s director of basketball analytics and development.</p><p>Battier will be inducted into the College Basketball Hall of Fame as a player Nov. 24 in Kansas City along with Indiana’s Calbert Cheaney, Purdue’s Terry Dischinger, UNLV’s Larry Johnson, Providence’s Ernie DiGregorio, and Stanford’s Todd Lichti.

At the time, the Grizzlies were in the process of moving from&nbsp;Vancouver&nbsp;to&nbsp;Memphis.&nbsp;Pau Gasol&nbsp;of Spain was selected in the same draft with the number three pick, by the Atlanta Hawks, then traded to the Grizzlies.</p><p>Battier was a versatile player with the size to play inside and the range to score from further out (particularly the corner&nbsp;three-pointer). However, he made his living as a hustle player on the defensive end, where he defended three positions (shooting guard,&nbsp;power forward,&nbsp;small forward) with a high degree of skill, netted a good number of&nbsp;blocks&nbsp;and&nbsp;steals, dove for loose balls, and frequently drew&nbsp;offensive fouls&nbsp;from his opponent.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=return-to-memphis-2011></span><span id=Return_to_Memphis_(2011) class=mw-headline>Return to Memphis (2011)</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>On February 24, Battier was traded by the&nbsp;Houston Rockets&nbsp;back to the&nbsp;Memphis Grizzlies, where Battier was originally drafted and played the first years of his career, in exchange for center&nbsp;Hasheem Thabeet,&nbsp;DeMarre Carroll, and a 1st round draft pick. On April 17, with Memphis down by two, Battier made the game-winning three, helping Memphis to its first playoff win in franchise history, following losses in its first 12 playoff games.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=miami-heat-2011%e2%80%932014></span><span id=Miami_Heat_(2011–2014) class=mw-headline>Miami Heat (2011–2014)</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>Battier as a member of the Heat in 2012 Battier signed on as a member of the Heat on December 9, 2011. On March 2, 2012, Battier scored a season-high 18 points, going 6–7 from the three-point line, in a one-point loss to the&nbsp;Utah Jazz. In-Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Boston Celtics, Battier recorded his first career playoff double-double in a 93–79 win. In the&nbsp;2012 NBA Finals, Battier scored 58 points in five games and won his first NBA Championship. His 11.6 points per game exceeded his 4.8 average in the 2011–12 regular season, and he made 15–26 three-point shots. His 57.7 three-point shooting percentage in the 2012 NBA Finals is the highest three-point shooting percentage ever recorded by a player who made 15 or more three-pointers in an NBA Finals series<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=personal-life></span><span id=Personal_life class=mw-headline>Personal life</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In summer 2004, Battier married Heidi Ufer, his high school sweetheart.&nbsp;They had their first son, Zeke Edward Battier, on June 2, 2008. On April 17, 2011, Heidi had their second child, a daughter named Eloise.</p><p>Battier is a co-owner of D1 Sports Training in Memphis. In 2010 Battier was chosen as the seventh-smartest athlete in sports by&nbsp;Sporting News. Battier has said that following the United States Senator&nbsp;Carl Levin’s 2013 announcement of retirement, the&nbsp;Michigan Democratic Party&nbsp;contacted Battier to gauge his interest in potentially running for the Senate, but he was not interested in running.</p><p>In August 2015, he lost his younger brother, Jeremy (football star at Detroit Country Day and former Duke football player, but sidelined by concussion injuries) to the ever-growing heroin epidemic. Not too long after Jeremy’s death, Jeremy’s wife, Dr. Shawna, died from a heroin overdose as well. They both ran a chic and successful dental boutique (Seven Star Dental) in Ohio.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=shane-battier-twitter></span>Shane Battier Twitter<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tweets by ShaneBattier</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKuYlrumecGaq62hlad6o7XOZpignV2brq61y7JksKGWmnqvsdNmrqiqpJ16r67AZquwoaSpsrN7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fshane-battier-bio-age-family-wife-net-worth-nba-twitter.html&text=Shane%20Battier%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20worth%2c%20NBA%2c%20Twitter&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fshane-battier-bio-age-family-wife-net-worth-nba-twitter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fshane-battier-bio-age-family-wife-net-worth-nba-twitter.html&title=Shane%20Battier%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20worth%2c%20NBA%2c%20Twitter" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fshane-battier-bio-age-family-wife-net-worth-nba-twitter.html&title=Shane%20Battier%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20worth%2c%20NBA%2c%20Twitter" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fshane-battier-bio-age-family-wife-net-worth-nba-twitter.html&title=Shane%20Battier%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20worth%2c%20NBA%2c%20Twitter" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fshane-battier-bio-age-family-wife-net-worth-nba-twitter.html&description=Shane%20Battier%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20worth%2c%20NBA%2c%20Twitter" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./why-did-zoe-kravitz-delete-all-her-instagram-posts.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="This Is Why Zo Kravitz Despises Social Media (And Deleted Her Instagram Pics)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./gal-gadot-sexy-dance-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="See Gal Gadot Do A Sexy Dance While Playing Bartender">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
