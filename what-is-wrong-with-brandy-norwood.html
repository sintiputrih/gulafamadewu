Her career stems as far back as 1993 and is most known for her role as Moesha on the now defunct UPN network, as well as her first few hits I Wanna Be Down and Sittin' Up in My Room. Norwood's career excelled throughout the mid-1990s through the early 2000s, <a href=#>landing roles in the television version of Cinderella</a>, produced by the late Whitney Houston, and earning her very first number-one song on the Billboard Hot 100 for That Boy Is Mine, a duet with fellow R&B singer Monica.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brandy continued to focus on music, steadily releasing albums and even <a href=#>landing a role as a judge on the very first season of America's Got Talent</a>, and while she was excited to return as a judge on the show, her life would take a dramatic and sudden turn that would stick with the singer to this day.</p><h2 id=the-singer-has-been-open-about-her-mental-health-struggles>The Singer Has Been Open About Her Mental Health Struggles</h2><p>In late 2006, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brandy Norwood was involved in a car accident on the 405 Freeway</a>. Brandy was driving her 2007 Land Rover when she failed to slow down and hit the back of a 2005 Honda going 65 mph. The Honda hit another vehicle and slid before it hit the center divider, where it was struck again by another oncoming vehicle.</p><p>While Brandy was not injured, the driver of the Honda, who was identified as Awatef Abdoudihaj, died of blunt force trauma at the hospital. This event, which followed the end of her relationship with the father of her daughter, stuck with the singer for a long time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="The Kardashians Dragged After It Emerges Brandy's Mom Sued Them For Theft">The Kardashians Dragged After It Emerges Brandy's Mom Sued Them For Theft</a></span></p><p>In an interview with People Magazine, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brandy admitted that she contemplated self-harm after the event</a>, and recalls laying in bed feeling "super depressed." She admits that it was the thought of <a href=#>her daughter, Sy'Rai Iman Smith</a>, that got her through her dark times.</p><p>The singer was quoted as saying "I [told] myself, 'So, you're just going to go out like this? That's wack. You have a daughter. If you can't do it for yourself, do it for her because this is not the way to leave a mark in her life."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And Norwood has continued to work on her mental health, getting it out with records like Borderline and Bye Bipolar, although the singer did clarify that she is not diagnosed with bipolar disorder.</p><p>Brandy also admits to being in therapy and actively practices meditation and journaling, while also staying on top of her faith</p><h2 id=norwood-has-been-hospitalized-for-physical-ailments>Norwood Has Been Hospitalized For Physical Ailments</h2><p>Along with Brandy's mental health struggles, the songstress appears to have had some physical struggles as well. In 2017, it was reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she lost consciousness after boarding a Delta Air Lines flight </a>at LAX. Sources close to the singer attributed the incident to exhaustion.</p><p>They admitted that Brandy was in the studio all night until it was time for her flight to depart and that she had recently taken more than 10 flights due to touring. Brandy had reportedly regained consciousness by the paramedics arrived to remove her from the plane.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# title=" What Does Ray J's Sister Brandy Think Of Kim Kardashian?"> What Does Ray J's Sister Brandy Think Of Kim Kardashian?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Norwood was scheduled to fly to JFK from LAX, but was still taken to the hospital for monitoring following the incident, and was released shortly thereafter to go home and rest. It was speculated that the singer may have been pregnant at the time, but those rumors proved to be false.</p><p>And this isn't the only time the Hollywood OG has been hospitalized, with another incident happening just a few short years later, with Brandy being taken to a Los Angeles hospital after EMS responded to a call from her home.</p><p>Fans of the singer wouldn't have to wait long for an update, with Brandy taking to Instagram to let her fans know that she is alright following the hospitalization that had just taken place.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brandy expressed that she was grateful for all of her fans and that she would "see [them] soon."</p><h2 id=did-brandy-have-a-seizure>Did Brandy Have A Seizure?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ was the first to break the news</a> of Brandy's most recent hospital stay, alleging that the singer possibly had a seizure that lead to the call to EMS that day. According to TMZ, sources close to Brandy advised them that they believe she suffered a seizure.</p><p>Norwood isn't known for a history of seizures, nor has she ever tested positive for any drugs during her hospital stays, so fans of the singer are likely taking this part of the news with a grain of salt until additional information is released.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Ray J Said There Was Never A Second Kim Tape; Kris Jenner Wants To 'Ruin' Him">Ray J Said There Was Never A Second Kim Tape; Kris Jenner Wants To 'Ruin' Him</a></span></p><p>It is also unknown at this time if there are possible other underlying health issues that lead up to both her 2017 and 2022 hospital stays, but Brandy says she is "following doctors orders and getting the rest I need due to dehydration and low amounts of nutrition."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans of Brandy have been quick in all incidences to show support and love to the singer, with fans flooding her with nothing but love, support, and well wishes for both her physical and mental health and reminding the star to continue to prioritize her health going forward.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0edarpqefXay2tbSMm6mappSueq%2B70bCmqJxf</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-wrong-with-brandy-norwood.html&text=Fans%20Are%20Worried%20About%20R%26amp%3bB%20Singer%20Brandy%20Norwood%20After%20Numerous%20Health%20Scares&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-wrong-with-brandy-norwood.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-wrong-with-brandy-norwood.html&title=Fans%20Are%20Worried%20About%20R%26amp%3bB%20Singer%20Brandy%20Norwood%20After%20Numerous%20Health%20Scares" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-is-wrong-with-brandy-norwood.html&title=Fans%20Are%20Worried%20About%20R%26amp%3bB%20Singer%20Brandy%20Norwood%20After%20Numerous%20Health%20Scares" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-wrong-with-brandy-norwood.html&title=Fans%20Are%20Worried%20About%20R%26amp%3bB%20Singer%20Brandy%20Norwood%20After%20Numerous%20Health%20Scares" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-wrong-with-brandy-norwood.html&description=Fans%20Are%20Worried%20About%20R%26amp%3bB%20Singer%20Brandy%20Norwood%20After%20Numerous%20Health%20Scares" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./gwen-stefani-stuns-string-bikini-teases-long-awaited-reveal.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gwen Stefani stuns in edgy string bikini as she teases long-awaited reveal">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-to-treat-scalp-sunburn.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Sunburned Scalp Is No Joke  Here's How to Deal">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
