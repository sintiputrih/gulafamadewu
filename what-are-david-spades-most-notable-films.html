From "Saturday Night Live" in its early years, to the silver screen, to everything else Spade has done in his career, his place in comedy history is secure.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Early Life and Career: First Step on Saturday Night Live</h2><p>After being cast in the 1987 film Police Academy 4, Spade started his journey into the world of entertainment as a standup comedian. The "Saturday Night Live" cast member from 1990 to 1996 ignominiously scaled the heights of the pop cultural pedestal. Often seen as the archetypal rich jerk, Spade brought his particular brand of sarcasm and cutting wit with characters and impersonations on the show, alongside the likes of Chris Farley and later, Chris Rock it had quickly gained him a reputation as one of the "Bad Boys" of SNL. His infamous recurring characters like the dismissive Total Bastard Airlines flight attendant and the sharp-tongued Hollywood Minute correspondent further indelibly imprinted him in the great pantheon of comedy.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Transition to Film and Television</h2><p>After his "SNL" departure, Spade headed to both the film and TV screens in major parts or supporting roles in a mix of hits. His roles in films like Tommy Boy (1995), Black Sheep (1996), and Joe Dirt (2001) further established his comedic chops, making him a leading figure in comedy starring to emerge.<br data-mce-fragment=1>Spade also performed well with roles in Just Shoot Me! and more recently his nuanced Sam Malone-like portrayal on Rules of Engagement. He later starred in Just Shoot Me! (1997–2003), 8 Simple Rules (2004–2005), and Rules of Engagement (2007–2013). He was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award for his performance in Just Shoot Me!</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Notable Films and TV Hosting</h2><p>Here are some of the best films by David Spade that should be included in his filmography:<br data-mce-fragment=1>12 Joe Dirt (2001) - His first solo starring role was a slight box-office success.<br data-mce-fragment=1>Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star (2003) - Co-written by Spade, yet another in the long line of cinematic vehicles that showcased his acting range.<br data-mce-fragment=1>Grown Ups (2010) and Grown Ups 2 (2013) - Hit at the box office, which saw Spade co-starring with Adam Sandler.<br data-mce-fragment=1>The Ridiculous 6 (2015) - The Do-Over (2016) - The Wrong Missy (2020)...indicative of a thriving career in comedy films.<br data-mce-fragment=1>In more recent years, Spade's TV presence expanded to hosting - on shows like The Showbiz Show with David Spade, and the late-night talk show programming Lights Out with David Spade - lending his dryly sarcastic, self-deprecating comedic voice to a bigger platform.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Influence and Impact</h2><p>David Spade has left his mark in the industry, and you can tell by how many appearances he continues to make in film and TV. His smooth transition from "SNL" to the big screen, along with his unmistakable gift for comedy, also makes him one of comedy's most beloved and revered figures. Collaborations with his fellow "SNL" castmates, especially Adam Sandler, also pointed to how he has remained a fixture in show business.<br data-mce-fragment=1>His tendency and ability to embody his comedic persona while simultaneously portraying a facade of self-deprecation has endeared Spade with audiences, and made him popular amongst moviegoers.
