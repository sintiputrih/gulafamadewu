After landing her first role in the romantic comedy film No Reservations<strong>,</strong> she went on to star in a series of other films such as Californication, Big Little Lies, High Fidelity, and Aladdin. However, she has also explored the voice acting space, voicing Catwoman in The Lego Batman Movie and Mary Jane Watson for Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Zoe Kravitz Blasts Will Smith's Oscars Slap">Zoe Kravitz Blasts Will Smith's Oscars Slap</a></span></p><p>Thanks to building such a successful career, the American actress, singer, and model is now worth an estimated $10 million US dollars. While acting is likely her main source of income, she has also dabbled in the modeling avenue. However, despite becoming such a highly recognized figure within the acting space, Kravitz has admitted that she has struggled with some elements of fame. But what exactly does she dislike about having such a large online presence?</p><h2 id=zo-euml-kravitz-actually-grew-up-with-famous-parents>Zoë Kravitz Actually Grew Up With Famous Parents</h2><p>Most fans may not know that Kravitz actually grew up with famous parents, Lisa Bonet, and well-known musician, Lenny Kravitz. Her mother is an actress too, just like her daughter, and is best known for her roles on The Cosby Show and A Different World.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Her net worth is an estimated $10 million</a>. Her father, Lenny Kravitz, is a very well-known singer and songwriter, who became best known for his music career. However, <a href=#>Zoe has expressed that at times she has felt 'embarrassed' from growing up with famous parents</a>. But why?</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In an interview with ELLE UK, the actress revealed that</a> "There was a little bit of embarrassment around what came with my last name," adding that people assumed that she was only successful because of her parents.</p><p>Kravitz noted, "People would always assume that if I got a job, it was because of that. That was hard."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Zoe Kravitz Shares Her Embarrassment At Growing Up With Famous Parents">Zoe Kravitz Shares Her Embarrassment At Growing Up With Famous Parents</a></span></p><p>However, in the same interview, she noted that she had an "incredible privilege" and that it definitely helped to "get her into the room."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She also revealed that she wanted to prove not only to the world but to herself, that she deserves to take up space in the industry, a statement that clearly portrays her passion for being an actress.</p><p>Again, she reinforced how grateful she was for her parents, stating that they were 'awesome' and that she is grateful to be their child.</p><h2 id=zo-euml-is-a-very-private-person>Zoë Is A Very Private Person</h2><p>Despite living life in the spotlight, Zoe is actually a very private person, and it is not often that the actress is seen commenting on her personal life.

It’s a hard thing to talk about, because no one wants to feel bad for people who have wonderful lives.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=zo-euml-kravitz-hates-social-media-because-it-39-s-a-39-power-struggle-39>Zoë Kravitz Hates Social Media Because It's A 'Power Struggle'</h2><p>While some people may dream about online fame, others have rather unsavory opinions about it — and Zoë Kravitz is one of them. In an interview with Elle, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the X-Men star revealed that she certainly feels the pressures of social media</a>, adding that 'you have to be careful what you say' on the platforms.</p><p>"We live in this time where people are triggered and people are sensitive. But then people are saying horrible, horrible things to each other on the internet, it's all just a power struggle."</p><p>These comments are certainly reflective of the actions that she took online in 2021 when Zoe deleted all her Instagram posts after receiving a swathe of hate comments about the way she chose to dress at the annual Met Gala.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many of the hate comments seemed to focus on the fact that they believed she was 'showing too much skin'. However, Zoe was fed up with online hate.</p><p>Following the hate, the clap back prompted the star to only post one single photo for the rest of the year.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking about the occurrence</a> she told ELLE UK: "The fact that people don’t think what they say affects a celebrity because you’re not a person to them is crazy."</p><p>In the same interview, she went into more depth, explaining how the platform makes her question herself at times.</p><p>"The fact that I’m like, 'Should I have not worn that?' No, I do what I want to do, and I make what I want to make, and if I’m now starting to be afraid of what other people are going to say or think," she explained. "I’m walking on eggshells."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, it seems like the actress is well and truly fed up with social media, like many others on the platform.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbaledmonGajopbDqsDZZpuepJWpsm6ty6VkoZ2iYravv9OanquZnWK9sL%2FTrGY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-did-zoe-kravitz-delete-all-her-instagram-posts.html&text=This%20Is%20Why%20Zo%20Kravitz%20Despises%20Social%20Media%20%28And%20Deleted%20Her%20Instagram%20Pics%29&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-did-zoe-kravitz-delete-all-her-instagram-posts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-did-zoe-kravitz-delete-all-her-instagram-posts.html&title=This%20Is%20Why%20Zo%20Kravitz%20Despises%20Social%20Media%20%28And%20Deleted%20Her%20Instagram%20Pics%29" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-did-zoe-kravitz-delete-all-her-instagram-posts.html&title=This%20Is%20Why%20Zo%20Kravitz%20Despises%20Social%20Media%20%28And%20Deleted%20Her%20Instagram%20Pics%29" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-did-zoe-kravitz-delete-all-her-instagram-posts.html&title=This%20Is%20Why%20Zo%20Kravitz%20Despises%20Social%20Media%20%28And%20Deleted%20Her%20Instagram%20Pics%29" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-did-zoe-kravitz-delete-all-her-instagram-posts.html&description=This%20Is%20Why%20Zo%20Kravitz%20Despises%20Social%20Media%20%28And%20Deleted%20Her%20Instagram%20Pics%29" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./abductor-who-raped-child-walking-to-school-at-gunpoint-in-southeast-dc-sentenced-doj.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Abductor Who Raped Child Walking To School At Gunpoint In Southeast DC Sentenced: DOJ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./shane-battier-bio-age-family-wife-net-worth-nba-twitter.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Shane Battier Bio, Age, Family, Wife, Net worth, NBA, Twitter">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
