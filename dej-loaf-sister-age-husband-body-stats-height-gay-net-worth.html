Dej Loaf’s promising music career is a childhood dream she is now living in a world that has embraced his style with open arms.&nbsp;The rapper, singer, and songwriter has collaborated with many notable artists, including The Game and Eminem.&nbsp;Besides killing him on the mic, there’s so much to know about the Michigan rap icon.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Dej Loaf Biography, (Age)</span></strong></h2><p><span>She was born Deja Trimble on April 8, 1991 in Detroit, Michigan, to parents Latrice Hudson and Sidney Fritzgerald Trimble.&nbsp;Losing her father at the age of 4, the singer, who knew about the whole episode at the time, continued to listen to music with her grandmother, while her interest in art continued. to grow.&nbsp;Eventually, Dej, whose inclination for music overflowed, started writing songs at the age of 9.</span></p><p><span>She and her brother had moved in with her grandmother as their own mother was still very traumatized by their father’s untimely death at the time.&nbsp;Even after a few years, the shock was still present in the lives of family members, especially Dej, who was often left alone at school.&nbsp;She quickly found expression in writing her own songs to vent and better deal with her grief and frustration;&nbsp;little did she know she was building a portfolio that would soon form the basis of her stardom.</span></p><p><span>Dej Loaf attended Southeastern High School and graduated in 2009 before continuing on to Saginaw Valley State University, also in Michigan, to study nursing.&nbsp;However, her interest in music outweighing her desire for an education, she left college after three semesters to devote herself fully to her musical career.&nbsp;Forming her own stage name, she ventured into music in 2011.</span></p><p><span>After two years of struggles and searching for it, she released her first mixtape Just Just It in 2013. The success of the production had caught the attention of rappers such as SAYITAINTTONE, who later covered it on his label IBGM (I Been Gettin’ Money).&nbsp;Under his guidance, she released her breakthrough single ‘Try Me’ which became a huge hit and was certified Gold in the United States in 2015. The song which made its way to the billboard charts was promoted by the Canadian rapper Drake who posted part of it.&nbsp;on his Instagram handle.</span></p><p><span>Having become famous, Dej signed a contract with the renowned “Colombia Records” and soon released her second mixtape.&nbsp;</span><span>Selling Sole</span><span>, which was widely recommended by reviewers.&nbsp;In 2015, she performed on Nicki Minaj’s “The Pinkprint Tour,” where she was booked to rap when the show opened.&nbsp;Gaining more traction, she and rapper Lil Durk released a track called “My Beyonce” in 2015. The same year, she released her debut EP, which was a smash hit.&nbsp;Dej Loaf released his third mixtape&nbsp;</span><span>All Jokes Apart</span><span>&nbsp;in 2016, the same year his debut album “Liberated” was due out.</span></p><h2><strong><span>His net worth</span></strong></h2><p><span>Dej Loaf’s net worth is estimated at $2 million.&nbsp;The talented rapper owes her efforts to the music for the aforementioned character collected over her career years.&nbsp;Releasing a single certified both gold and platinum was not only a record bonus, it boosted the income of this talented rapper.</span></p><p><span>Pain who is considered one of the most popular female rappers in the industry also earns a lot from her music tours and shows.&nbsp;On analysis, his net worth of $2 million could become an insignificant number in a few years, considering the rapper’s rapid rise to fame.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Personal life – sister, husband, is she gay?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Much has been said about Loaf’s brother but not much has been heard of his sister.&nbsp;The rapper announced to the world that her sister, a hairstylist, posted her photo on Instagram.&nbsp;The caption on the photo that highlights the relationship between the two says it all.&nbsp;Fans were also won over by the resemblance.&nbsp;What we don’t know though is why his sister wasn’t painted in his childhood painting.</span></p><p><span>There have been various speculations about the rapper’s sexuality.&nbsp;Considering her feminine exterior and alpha style of music, some have considered Dej a lesbian.&nbsp;This assumption was reinforced by public criticism with his alleged ex-girlfriend Aye Redd.&nbsp;After getting together with fellow rapper Lil Durk in 2015, Redd praised Loaf for faking a relationship with the opposite sex only to hide his gay sexuality.&nbsp;But the rapper refuted those claims, saying she only dresses like a tomboy because she likes to be comfortable, and added that girls love her.</span></p><p><span>It was the talk of his sexuality that sparked further discussion of his marital status, with many wondering if the rapper has a husband.&nbsp;But according to Dej Loaf, she is single.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Body statistics, height and weight</span></strong></h2><p><span>Deja Trimble may not be the greatest but she has the right body to suit her career.&nbsp;She measures an average height of 5’2 and 3 quarters (159.4 cm), which is commensurate with her weight of 56 kg (123 lb).&nbsp;Dej and her beautiful 33-25-35 body fit a size 6 (US) or 36 (EU) for her dresses and she wears a size 13 (US) for her shoes.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiclZ96rbvAn2SsoaOpsrN5wKCcZqClqK%2BiusNmmaicqWLAta3TrGShnZmctbV5xpqwZqaVqXq4u9Gtn2g%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdej-loaf-sister-age-husband-body-stats-height-gay-net-worth.html&text=DeJ%20Loaf%20Sister%2c%20Age%2c%20Husband%2c%20Body%20Stats%2c%20Height%2c%20Gay%2c%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdej-loaf-sister-age-husband-body-stats-height-gay-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdej-loaf-sister-age-husband-body-stats-height-gay-net-worth.html&title=DeJ%20Loaf%20Sister%2c%20Age%2c%20Husband%2c%20Body%20Stats%2c%20Height%2c%20Gay%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdej-loaf-sister-age-husband-body-stats-height-gay-net-worth.html&title=DeJ%20Loaf%20Sister%2c%20Age%2c%20Husband%2c%20Body%20Stats%2c%20Height%2c%20Gay%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdej-loaf-sister-age-husband-body-stats-height-gay-net-worth.html&title=DeJ%20Loaf%20Sister%2c%20Age%2c%20Husband%2c%20Body%20Stats%2c%20Height%2c%20Gay%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdej-loaf-sister-age-husband-body-stats-height-gay-net-worth.html&description=DeJ%20Loaf%20Sister%2c%20Age%2c%20Husband%2c%20Body%20Stats%2c%20Height%2c%20Gay%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./gene-steratore-net-worth-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gene Steratore Net Worth 2024">&larr;
