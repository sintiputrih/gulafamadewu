He starred opposite Johnny Depp twice, first in his breakthrough role in <i>Finding Neverland </i>and later as Charlie Bucket in <i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i>, and then he played a young music prodigy in the sentimental tearjerker <i>August Rush</i>. A few years ago, while beginning his studies in both Arabic and Spanish at Cambridge, he filmed the 2011 Sundance entry <i>The Art of Getting By </i>(formerly <i>Homework</i>) opposite Emma Roberts, a performance that caught the eye of <a href=#>Vera Farmiga</a>, with whom he currently stars in A&E’s <i>Bates Motel</i> (premiering tonight at ten). Vulture recently chatted with Highmore, who just turned 21, about playing a young Norman Bates, filming atop an old dump in Vancouver, and why the comparisons to <i>Twin Peaks </i>are exactly right. (Minor spoilers about the pilot within!)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4852f0d80c3ae2638c6ddeeab8672351-3-0-0@published data-word-count=27><b>My most vivid memory of you is from quite a while ago.

But then he goes, “Ha-ha, <i>Jane Eyre</i>; I was just joking with you, Mom.” It’s like Chekov’s gun, isn’t it?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4852f0d80c3ae2638c6ddeeab8672351-8-0-0@published data-word-count=152><b>Series boss Carlton Cuse has said he thinks of Norman’s story as primarily a tragedy.<br></b>Yeah. I think the idea is that he’s a nice person who things have happened to that might turn him different. There are a lot of moments, even in the pilot, where you see him outside of this bond with his mother living a relatively normal life. He goes off to the party and he meets a girl that he fancies, and he’s almost gonna get her, but he doesn’t, and that’s okay. But he’s always kind of ultimately unsatisfied. [<i>Laughs.</i>] There’s that dramatic irony of us always knowing he’s going to wind up a killer, so you think, <i>Oh no, Norman, you don’t have to go down that route!</i> <i>Maybe if you didn’t have your mother or stayed out in this other world and enjoyed your parties more you might end up being an okay guy!</i></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4852f0d80c3ae2638c6ddeeab8672351-9-0-0@published data-word-count=90><b>It’s funny how no one on the show is using the word horror to talk about the show. No one says, “Yeah, it’s super creepy!”<br></b>I guess we’re so used to it. Also, [the characters] don’t see it as creepy themselves. There’s no need for them to be, “Oh <i>yes</i>, I love you <i>too,</i> Mother.” It’s more delicious when it’s played completely straight and the audience is left to think, <i>That’s not quite right</i>. It’s a tease. TV in general is a lot about teasing people and setting things up.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4852f0d80c3ae2638c6ddeeab8672351-10-0-0@published data-word-count=121><b>You’ve got two majors at Cambridge, which sounds like a full load. Why were you interested in taking on a television project at the same time?<br></b>I’ll be able to finish my courses at the same time. It works out together. The role was just brilliant, and A&E seemed to be very committed from the start, doing ten episodes and putting a lot behind it. It’s nice to go in having that kind of support. Also, we had so many scripts before we started, I think we had six of them, and that’s so great to know where it’s going before you start, as opposed to having just the one hour. It’s my first experience of television, so I don’t know.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4852f0d80c3ae2638c6ddeeab8672351-11-0-0@published data-word-count=86><b>It’s not normal.<br></b>Yeah, that’s what everyone’s saying to me. And I like that although there are dark moments and violent moments, although as violent as it gets is in the pilot and that’s not the main part of it, there’s also a dark humor that Vera and I often discuss and want to keep it in there. Like when we have to dispose of a body, dragging it down the stairs and it’s knocking into things and then it falls over her in the bath.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4852f0d80c3ae2638c6ddeeab8672351-12-0-0@published data-word-count=15><b>Or when Norman throws himself out the window.<br></b>[<i>Laughs.</i>] “I’m going to study, Mom!” <i>Wham!</i></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4852f0d80c3ae2638c6ddeeab8672351-13-0-0@published data-word-count=62><b>Did you and Vera do anything special to bond?<br></b>We studied together, yeah.

If you drove through White Pine Bay on a nice day, you’d think it was a lovely town. “Such nice people! Isn’t it pretty?” But once you’ve moved in you realize there’s a whole other side to it. Yeah. It’s set up a bit with that notebook Norman finds in the pilot. Like, <i>Hang on, maybe this town isn’t as pleasant as it seems.</i> And you’ll see that. Norman will have his own life to some extent. He goes to school. Norma isn’t there babysitting him every day. He’s let loose. And Norma similarly will develop relationships with characters Norman doesn’t meet.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4852f0d80c3ae2638c6ddeeab8672351-15-0-0@published data-word-count=117><b>So, why do you guys film near a dump?</b><br>I think there are a few reasons. It’s about an hour out of Vancouver, so it was <i>specially selected </i>within the radius of all the places they could have chosen. We’re actually on top of an old dump, and there’s also a new dump across the road. Honestly, I think part of the reason is it had the hill, like from the original <i>Psycho </i>house with the motel being down below, and then the big hill that [has] the house on the top. I think the house is actually sitting directly atop the old dump, and if the wind blows the wrong way, yeah, it smells quite bad.</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Freddie Highmore on Playing Young Norman Bates</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlobGdgaHyjrdOeqmaln6myrXnFq5ydnJmaeqm1xqGkqKqVYravwMSrraKdp2O1tbnL</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbates-motel-freddie-highmore-interview-html.html&text=Bates%20Motels%20Freddie%20Highmore%20on%20Playing%20Young%20Norman%20and%20the%20Shows%20Dark%20Humor&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbates-motel-freddie-highmore-interview-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbates-motel-freddie-highmore-interview-html.html&title=Bates%20Motels%20Freddie%20Highmore%20on%20Playing%20Young%20Norman%20and%20the%20Shows%20Dark%20Humor" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbates-motel-freddie-highmore-interview-html.html&title=Bates%20Motels%20Freddie%20Highmore%20on%20Playing%20Young%20Norman%20and%20the%20Shows%20Dark%20Humor" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbates-motel-freddie-highmore-interview-html.html&title=Bates%20Motels%20Freddie%20Highmore%20on%20Playing%20Young%20Norman%20and%20the%20Shows%20Dark%20Humor" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbates-motel-freddie-highmore-interview-html.html&description=Bates%20Motels%20Freddie%20Highmore%20on%20Playing%20Young%20Norman%20and%20the%20Shows%20Dark%20Humor" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./cindy-crawford-rande-gerber-adore-kaias-bf-jacob-elordi.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cindy Crawford, Rande Gerber 'Adore' Kaia's BF Jacob Elordi">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./123528-what-happened-linda-blue-bloods-actresss-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What happened to Linda from 'Blue Bloods'?
