It all started in 1962 with Dr. No starring Sean Connery as 007 and continues with Daniel Craig's last film in the latest installment, No Time To Die. Craig is officially hanging up his suit and gadgets and <a href=#>retiring his iconic role as James Bond</a>. The news comes as a shock to many who thought he had a few more movies in him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Who will reprise this iconic role and take over the Bond franchise?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'No Time to Die' Director Shades Sean Connery's James Bond, Linking His Portrayal As A 'Rapist'</a></span></p><p>British actress, <a href=#>Lashana Lynch will take over as the new 007</a> in future films. A female lead is something that will flip the entire script and create an entirely new generation of Bond films. Maybe now fans will get to see men vying for the attention of a female intelligent agent. As for past James Bond films, let's take a look at the beautiful women who complemented the leading men of the series for nearly six decades! Their roles haves turned them to the successful actresses they are today.</p><h2 id=eva-green-8-million><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Eva Green: $8 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Eva Green appeared in Daniel Craig's first-ever James Bond film, Casino Royale in 2006. This role was widely praised and has earned the actress a spot on this grand list. Interestingly, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Green actually turned down the role at first before later accepting it</a>. Casino Royale was the highest-grossing Bond film until another Craig installment, Skyfall, was released in 2012.</p><h2 id=gemma-arterton-8-5-million><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Gemma Arterton: $8.5 Million</span></h2><p>Gemma played the role of Strawberry Fields in the film Quantum of Solace alongside Daniel Craig. In 2008, there were two love interests for Bond including Olga Kurylenko as Camille Montes. Two is better than one right? Bond charmed his way into both these ladies' hearts, but Gemma Arterton left her mark on the fans. Gemma has accumulated this net worth from her roles in Clash of the Titans, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, and Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters. Unfortunately, her time as Bond girl ended in getting smothered in crude oil.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=denise-richards-12-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Denise Richards: $12 Million</span></h2><p><a href=#>Denise Richards is a very well-known American actress</a> and has appeared in many television shows as well as films. Richards' most recognized movie roles are Carmen Ibanez in 1997s Starship Troopers, Kelly Van Ryan in 1998s Wild Things, and of course, Christmas Jones in 1999s The World Is Not Enough. Denise Richards stepped into the shoes of the British secret agent’s lover but didn't receive all praise. Some fans believe her character was over-sexualized but she is still cashing in as one of the richest Bond girls.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Ana De Armas' Most Famous Roles Before The New James Bond Movie</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jill-st-john-20-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Jill St. John: $20 Million</span></h2><p>Jill St. John played Tiffany Case in 1971’s Diamonds Are Forever. This was only the seventh installment for the James Bond saga and Jill's most widely recognized appearance. Interestingly enough, Jill's love transpired off-screen since she dated not one, but two Bond actors – Sean Connery and George Lazenby. Neither romance lasted since she is currently married to actor Robert Wagner.</p><h2 id=ursula-anderson-25-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Ursula Anderson: $25 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Honey Diver is the face you think of when you think of classic James Bond girls. Swiss actress Ursula Anderson was one of the first Bond girls and she appears in 1962's Dr. No with Sean Connery. Anderson rose out of the Caribbean Sea in a white bathing suit with a huge knife on her hip which became an iconic scene in cinematic history.</p><h2 id=michelle-yeoh-40-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Michelle Yeoh: $40 Million</span></h2><p>Michelle Yeoh starred as Wai Lin in 1997’s Tomorrow Never Dies.

Yeoh starred in Crazy Rich Asians in 2018 and more recently, <strong>Marvel's</strong>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=teri-hatcher-50-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Teri Hatcher: $50 Million</span></h2><p>A pre-<a href=#>Desperate Housewives Teri Hatcher</a> was starring in Tomorrow Never Dies with Pierce Brosnan. Hatcher was cast as Paris Carver who was a married woman who was swooned by this attractive spy. Her character gave up important information to Bond after she slept with him and was then murdered by her husband. Teri Hatcher was one of the highest-paid actresses in the mid-2000s and deserves this impressive net worth.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Life Of Luisa Mattioli, Third Wife Of Bond Actor Roger Moore</a></span></p><h2 id=jane-seymour-60-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Jane Seymour: $60 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jane Seymour has secured her slot as on of the top 3 richest leading Bond ladies. This may be surprising to some, but the English actress has made her way into many popular films after her role in Live and Let Die in 1973. Seymour's breakout role was in Solitaire alongside actor Roger Moore. Jane Seymour’s successful career has earned her an Emmy Award and two Golden Globes Awards.</p><h2 id=halle-berry-80-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Halle Berry: $80 Million</span></h2><p>The Academy Award-winning actress Halle Berry was also once a Bond girl back in the day. In 2002, Berry played Giacinta 'Jinx' Johnson alongside Pierce Brosnan in 2002’s Die Another Day. Halle Berry was already on the rise when she accepted this role and her part only <a href=#>skyrocketed her career</a>.
