They then started dating and ultimately decided to get married the same year they met. On November 23, 1996, they got married. The family lived in Alpine, New Jersey, along with their daughters. Her ex-husband, stand-up comedian and actor Chris Rock, was born in Andrews, South California.</p><p>He has several years of experience as a writer, producer, and director in the entertainment industry.

Malaak uploaded pictures of her daughters to Instagram with the message, “They are my heartbeats and I love them.” Malaak has always treated her three daughters fairly.</p><p>She has demonstrated that family is built and preserved by love rather than blood, even though Ntombi is not her biological child. She is proud to be the mother of three gorgeous girls because all three of her children have grown up to be beautiful, strong women.</p><h2><span id=Why_were_Chris_and_Malaak_split_up>Why were Chris and Malaak split up?</span></h2><p>2014 saw Rock file for divorce. Chris admitted that his infidelity was the reason his 18-year marriage was terminated. Chris had an addiction to porn and had cheated on his wife.</p><p>He was required to make the alimony, child support, and additional payments that his wife had requested. Nevertheless, he argued that she is capable of working and providing for the children’s needs or her support.</p><p>Chris also refuses to give Ntombi child support because, in his words, he had nothing to do with the adoption of Ntombi. Malaak, however, insisted on getting support tailored to her way of life.</p><p>On August 22, 2016, the divorce was finalized. Following their divorce, Malaak and Chris both moved on with their lives. The strong, beautiful woman keeps posting pictures of herself online with her spouse.</p><p>Although she hasn’t revealed who her boyfriend is, we can reasonably conclude that they are really in love based on the postings. Actress Megalyn Echikunwoke is one of the gorgeous women Chris has been spotted with.</p><p>As of November 2022, Malaak Compton Rock’s net worth was $20 million.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>According To Evan Roberts, Every Women Is A Hero For Surviving Childbirth</a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>actor</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Kristen Meadows</a></h3>Kristen Meadows estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
