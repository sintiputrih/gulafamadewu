The enterprise platform has more memory channels, support for error correcting and high-density memory, the ability to communicate to multiple processors, and several other RAS (reliability, accessibility, serviceability) features that are prominent for these markets. These are typically disabled for the prosumer platform.</p><p>In the past, Intel has only translated the LCC silicon into the prosumer platform. This was driven for a number of reasons.</p><ul><li>Cost: if users needed XCC, they had to pay the extra and Intel would not lose high-end sales.</li><li>Software: Enterprise software is highly optimized for the core count, and systems are built especially for the customer. Prosumer software has to work on all platforms, and is typically not so multi-threaded.</li><li>Performance: Large, multi-core silicon often runs at a low frequency to compensate. This can be suitable for an enterprise environment, but a prosumer environment requires responsiveness and users expect a good interactive experience.</li><li>Platform Integration: Some large silicon might have additional design rules above and beyond the smaller silicon support, typically with power or features. In order to support this, a prosumer platform would require additional engineering/cost or lose flexibility.</li></ul><p>So what changed at Intel in order to bring HCC silicon to the HEDT prosumer platform?</p><p>The short and shrift answer that many point to is AMD. This year AMD launched its own high-end desktop platform, based on its Ryzen Threadripper processors. With their new high performance core, putting up to 16 of them in a processor for $999 was somewhat unexpected, especially with the processor beating Intelâ€™s top prosumer processors in some (not all) of the key industry benchmarks. The cynical might suggest that Intel had to move to the HCC strategy in order to stay at the top, even if their best processor will cost twice that of AMD.</p><p>Of course, transitioning a processor from the enterprise stack to the prosumer platform is not an overnight process, and many analysts have noted that it is likely that Intel has considered this option for several generations: testing it internally at least and looking at the market to decide when (or if) it is a good time to do so. The same analysts point to Intelâ€™s initial lack of specifications aside from core count when these processors were first announced several months ago: specifications that would have historically been narrowed down at that point in previous designs if they were in the original plans. It is likely that the feasibly of introducing the HCC silicon was already in process, but actually moving that silicon to retail was a late addition to counter a threat to Intelâ€™s top spot. That being said, to say Intel had never considered it would perhaps be a jump too far.</p><p>The question now becomes if the four areas listed above would all be suitable for prosumers and HEDT users:</p><ul><li>Cost: Moving the 18-core part into the $1999 is unprecedented for a consumer processor, so it will be interesting to see what the uptake will be. This does cut into Intelâ€™s professional product line, where the equivalent processor is nearer $3500, but there are enough â€˜cutsâ€™ on the prosumer part for Intel to justify the difference: memory channels (4 vs 6), multi-processor support (1 vs 4), and ECC/RDIMM support (no vs yes). What the consumer platform does get in kind is overclocking support, which the enterprise platform does not.</li><li>Software: Intel introduced its concept of â€˜mega-taskingâ€™ with the last generation HEDT platform, designed to encompass users and prosumers that use multiple software packages at once: encoding, streaming, content creation, emulation etc. Its argument now is that even if software cannot fully scale beyond a few cores, a user can either run multiple instances or several different software packages simultaneously without any slow-down. So the solution to this is rather a redefinition of the problem rather than anything else, which could have applied previously as well.</li><li>Performance: Unlike enterprise processors, Intel is pushing the frequency on the new HCC parts for consumers. This translates into a slightly lower base frequency but a much higher turbo frequency, along with support for Turbo Max. In essence, software that requires responsiveness can still take advantage of the high frequency turbo modes, as long as the software is running solo. The disadvantage is going to be in power consumption, which is a topic later in the review.</li><li>Platform Integration: Intel â€˜solvedâ€™ this by creating one consumer platform suitable for nine processors with three different designs (Kaby Lake-X, Skylake-X LCC and Skylake-X HCC). Both the Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X parts have different power delivery methods, support different numbers of memory channels, and different numbers of PCIe lanes / IO. When this was first announced, there was substantial commentary that this was making the platform overly complex, and would lead to confusion (it lead to at least one broken processor in our testing).</li></ul><p>Each of these areas has either been marked as solved, or redefined out of being issue (even if a user agrees with the redefinition or not).&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH5yhJJyZqKmpJq5bq%2FOq5xmoWlihHqEj7GcZpmemXqku9GeZKJxXWyGd3zXZqmerpmaxHB%2F</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fintel-core-i9-7980xe-and-core-i9-7960x-review.html&text=Explaining%20the%20Jump%20to%20Using%20HCC%20Silicon&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fintel-core-i9-7980xe-and-core-i9-7960x-review.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fintel-core-i9-7980xe-and-core-i9-7960x-review.html&title=Explaining%20the%20Jump%20to%20Using%20HCC%20Silicon" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fintel-core-i9-7980xe-and-core-i9-7960x-review.html&title=Explaining%20the%20Jump%20to%20Using%20HCC%20Silicon" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fintel-core-i9-7980xe-and-core-i9-7960x-review.html&title=Explaining%20the%20Jump%20to%20Using%20HCC%20Silicon" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fintel-core-i9-7980xe-and-core-i9-7960x-review.html&description=Explaining%20the%20Jump%20to%20Using%20HCC%20Silicon" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./liam-gallagher-bio-age-parents-siblings-wife-children.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Liam Gallagher Bio, Age, Parents, Siblings, Wife, Children">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./cubitek-hptx-ice-review-how-far-aluminum-can-go.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Assembling the Cubitek HPTX ICE">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
